            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore for a full recommendation aſwell of the Author, as alſo of the woorke it ſelfe, I intende through GOD his aſſiſtaunce too ſette foorth none other thing, then the ſame fruite and profite, which they haue already gotten, that haue read them, and that fruite which they may make reporte of, that ſhall hereafter reade them. For this may very well be thought that nothing in the whole worlde maketh a man more bleſſed, then the liuely and continuall meditation of the holy lawe and good will of our heauenly father.

And herewithal let vs note this by the way: That weal, ought too knowe and vnderſtand this Pſalme as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as our Pater noſter as we vſually ſay. But here we muſt not ſay as a number of men doo, that our wit &amp; capacities are not ſo excellent and fyne, as to comprehende &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the holy ſcriptures: and beſides, that oure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie will not ſerue too reteine and keepe that whiche ſometymes is preached vntoo vs. A ſtraunge caſe: wee will eaſely retaine and keepe in minde not onely vayne and fooliſhe ſonges and ditties, but alſo ſuch as are both wanton &amp; diſſolute, &amp; euen ſuch as S. Paule ſayth, doe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and poyſon good manners, for this horrible infection is always ſhutte vp for an euil intent and purpoſe. For if wee ſhall heare any villainous and ribaudrous ſong, which ſhall only ſtirre vs vp all to all filthy luſt and ſhameleſneſſe the ſame by and by we retaine with great eaſe.</p>
            <p>Beholde nowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how the Lorde our God here teacheth vs as it were by an A. B. C. a moſte excellent ſong amongſt the reſt, by which we may learne to rule &amp; order our liues, whereby alſo he exhorteth vs to well dooing, to comforte vs in all our afflictions, to ratifie vnto vs the promiſſes of ſaluation, too open vnto vs the Gates of his euerlaſting Kingdome, that wee might enter into euerlaſting life: and all this is contayned within this A. B. C. of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pſalme, and yet wee will all ſay that our memory
<pb facs="tcp:7694:7"/>is ouer ſhorte, and our witte too too groſſe, or weake to holde it. Nowe I beſeech you tell mee this, will this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe goe for payment or not? Verely I beleeue not, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs learne to beſtowe our whole indeuour and ſtudy to recorde the leſſons which are heere taught vs: &amp; that we may be heerafter throughly acquainted with this Pſalme, if we wil be repured &amp; take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the children of God. And ſeeing we ſee our nature to be giuen to many vngodly and pernicious, or at the leaſt to very vnprofitable thing: let vs yet retaine and holde that which ſhall be moſte profitable for vs, and the rather becauſe that God ſo abaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the moſte rude, ſimple, and ignoraunteſt emong vs. For mine owne parte, becauſe I will frame my ſelfe to that manner and order which the holy Ghoſte hath heere ſet downe, I ſhall inforce my ſelfe to followe as briefely as I can the plaine and true meaning of the text: and without continuing in longe exhortations. I will onely doe my beſte too mince or ſhred, as we ſay, the wordes of Dauid, becauſe wee may the better digeſt them. For performance whereof, I determine by the grace of God, too finiſhe eight verſes aparte in euery Sermon, and to holde my ſelfe with in ſuch a compaſſe, as that the moſt ignoraunt ſhall eaſily, acknowledge and confeſſe that I meane nothing elſe but to make open and playne the ſimple and pure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the text. And nowe let vs come to the contents if the firſt viii. verſes apart, beginning with the firſt letter Aleph: <hi>Bleſſed are they</hi> (ſaith Dauid) <hi>which are vpright in the way: and walke in the Lawe of the Lorde.</hi> Firſt of all, he doth vs heere to witte, that we vnderſtand not wherin our chiefe bleſſedneſſe conſiſteth, and the reaſon is, becauſe that wee are blinde, and doe liue in the worlde as ſauage? and wilde beaſtes, vtterly voyde of ſenſe and reaſon: and ſuffer our ſelues to be ledde and carryed away of our brutiſhe and ſwiniſh affections and luſtes. And becauſe it is ſo, that we are thus carryed away, it is a manifeſt ſigne and token that wee diſcerne not good from euill: or elſe that the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7694:7"/>Deuill hath ſo bewitched vs, that wee thinke thereof no whitte at all. True it is that the moſte wicked wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and ſay, that they deſire too bee ſaued but yet in the deſire thereof, they cleerely flye from it, and goe as cleane away from it, as they can for their liues.</p>
            <p>But what is the cauſe whye they ſo greately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe them ſelues from that which they ſo highly proteſte too loue? Yea they drawe as neere vnto it, as they can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly flye from it. By this it ſeemeth that they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyred too reiecte and make little accounte of that good which GOD meaneth to doe for them. And heere we are too note, that Dauid in this firſte verſe accuſeth vs of horrible blindeneſſe, as if he ſhould ſay, Surely you are all ſenſeleſſe and without witte. And to ſay the trueth if there were but one droppe of reaſon in vs, without doubte, wee would not ſo reiecte and refuſe our ſaluation of a ſett pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as wee doe. See heere howe mercifully our good God dealeth with vs, who ſheweth vs howe and in what manner we may be bleſſed, and yet we for all that drawe altogither backwarde. Doth not Dauid then of very right, iuſtly condemne vs? But becauſe euery of vs proteſteth to knowe the right way, hee addeth, <hi>They which walke in the way of the Lorde.</hi> Hee hath ſayde: <hi>Bleſſed are they which are vndefiled in their way:</hi> that is, whiche walke aright. And who are they? It is very true in deede as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue ſayde, that there are a greate number, which will boaſt them ſelues too walke aright, and that in ſuch ſorte, as that it can not be much amended: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if they be aſked who made their way, and who it is that aſſureth them that they ſhoote at the true marke, they knowe not what aunſwere to make. For there is but one way which leadeth to ſaluation, which is the law: as Dauid heereof ſpeaketh, wherefore as many as walke in the Lawe of the Lorde, ſayth he, goe not out of their way. We haue in this firſte verſe twoo notable leſſons: The one is, that God heere acuſeth vs, that euery of vs ſtrayeth and
<pb facs="tcp:7694:8"/>erreth from the way of ſaluation, and although wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſte that we are willing and deſirous to bee ſaued, yet for all that our wicked affections doe in ſuch ſorte carry vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as that we deſire nothing elſe but that wee may bee farre from that felicitie and bleſſedneſſe which is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs. For there it is ſayde, <hi>Bleſſed are they which walke in the right way.</hi> And thus much for the firſt poynte. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde is, That wee may inuent and deuiſe many and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kindes of life, and ſo think that we go the beſt &amp; ſureſt way that may be, and by this meane deceiue our ſelues, for there is but one way that leadeth to ſaluation. What way is it? It is not that which wee of our owne braine doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: For when Iſaiah ſayth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53.6.</note> that euery one hath declined from his way, he meaneth that we all runne into euerlaſting deſtruction. The Law of God then is the way which muſt rule and order our life, and when we will hearken vnto it, all thinges ſhall goe well with vs, but whoſoeuer ſwarueth from that, the ſame is like vnto a ſauage and wilde beaſte, which can doe nothing elſe but gallopp and flinge ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the fieldes. There is none of vs all but that may haue many motions which may ſeeme good to vs, as wee may ſee by the poore and filly vnbeleeuers, which are very feruent and earneſt to doe this or that, which too their thinking ſeemeth very good and profitable: but yet the ſpirit of God is not their leader and guide.</p>
            <p>Nowe it is ſayde, That when wee haue the lawe of God before vs, it ſhal go wel with vs: &amp; that without it, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but that our life muſt needes bee confounded and come to naught. He ſayth a little after, <hi>Bleſſed are they which keepe his Teſtimonies: and ſeek him with their whole heart.</hi> Dauid now vſeth another worde, then this word the law, to wit, teſtimonies. This word in it ſelf importeth a couenant or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract, &amp; it is not to be vnderſtood otherwiſe than to be ayplyed to this end: to wit, that God couenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with vs, declareth, that his meaning is to pull &amp; draw vs vnto him, and alſo howe we ought to order our life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7694:8"/>cauſe it is a mutuall Contract betweene him and vs. As if he ſhould haue ſaide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Goe to now, vnderſtand you that heere I make a couenaunt with you, that you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge mee to bee your GOD: That you doubte not of my loue towards you, and in louing you that I am your Sauiour, and that you call vppon mee in this affiaunce and truſt, and beſides that you bee alſo my louing &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Children, that I doo protect and gouerne you, and that you are my houſeholde Seruauntes. When the Lorde our GOD thus abaſeth and offereth him ſelfe vnto vs, and that hee vſeth ſuche famyliaritie and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towardes vs, as to talke with vs, It is ſayde, that hee giueth vs his Teſtimonyes of his loue and fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs.</p>
            <p>Heere nowe Dauid declareth, That they are bleſſed which keepe the Teſtimonyes of GOD: and ſeeke him with their whole hearte. As if hee ſhoulde ſay that the Lawe of God conſiſteth not onely in this, that it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vnto vs what wee ought too doo, but that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth alſo with it another ſpeciall Doctrine: too weete, to aſſure vs that hee will bee our Father, that hee loueth vs ſo deerely that hee deſireth none other thing of vs, but that wee woulde bee his ſonnes and heyres. And heerevnto tende all the Ceremonyes, whereof wee ſhall ſpeake hereafter more at large. Yet this is true, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in this place aboueſayde, as alſo by the reſte of the names couched in this Pſalme, as of Statutes, Decrees, and Ordinaunces, Dauid alwayes meaneth the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Lawe. Howbeit it is to be noted, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of woordes, it is not heere ſette downe without good cauſe. For it expreſſeth moſte plainely vnto vs, what varietie of conſolation wee receiue by that which GOD ſheweth vnto vs in the Lawe of Moyſes, and in all the Prophetes, who are as it were Expoſitors thereof. For many times when wee ſpeake of the Lawe, wee ſuppoſe that there is nothing elſe meant but that which GOD
<pb facs="tcp:7694:9"/>commaundeth vs to do. But there is a great deale more to be conſidered: to witte, hee aſſureth vs of his fauour and grace, and willeth vs to ſtaye our ſelues thereon, that wee might be aſſured of our ſaluation, and that alſo we might be certaine of his loue by his ſacraments therein ordeined. Moreouer, that wee ſhoulde addreſſe our ſelues to Ieſus Chriſt, and by that meanes be inſtructed to runne vnto him who is our onely and alone Sauiour. When God then ſpeaketh vnto vs, we muſt conſider that hee ſaith not onely, doe this, or that, but declareth himſelfe vnto vs, what manner of one wee ſhould thinke him to be, and what one alſo he ſheweth him ſelfe on his parte too be towardes vs, both by experience and effecte. This diuerſitie of woords vſed heere in this Pſalme by Dauid, is not ſuperfluous: For it ſheweth vs that the Lawe of God doth hot onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde vs how wee ſhould liue, and after what ſorte: but doth alſo certifie vs of the good will of God, promiſeth vs ſaluation, leadeth vs too Ieſus Chriſte; ſtirreth vs vp too call vpon the name of God, giueth vs Ceremonies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs therein, and moreouer, that it guideth, &amp; holdeth vs within our limits. And ſurely there is not one verſe in all this Pſalme (although there are very many) wherein there is not mention made of one of theſe wordes, too witte, either of the lawe of God, or of his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, either elſe of his Ordinaunces, Statutes, or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes, or of his voice, Iudgementes, or Iuſtice. Theſe wordes are heere ſo many times repeated, as that there is not one verſe, but that there is one or ſometimes twoo of them in it: as heereafter wee ſhall ſee throughout the whole Pſalme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And now let vs come to the matter heerin contayned: <hi>Bleſſed are they which keepe the Teſtimonies of the Lorde: and which ſeeke him with their whole heart.</hi> Firſt Dauid decala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth heere (as afore ſaid) that wee haue greatly profited in the lawe, when as wee ſhall acknowledge and confeſſe what affection and loue God beareth vs, and how we ought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7694:9"/>to aſſure our ſelues of his good will and fatherly loue. And afterward he telleth vs to what end and purpoſe it is, that God graunteth vnto vs ſuch an aſſurance, bicauſe (ſaith he) we ſhould ſeeke him. For this is moſt ſure, when as we ſhall vnderſtand God to be ſuch a one, as he declareth himſelfe vnto vs by his worde, it is impoſsible but that wee ſhoulde ſtirre vp our ſelues, and be moued to giue our ſelues wholy vnto him. And to proue that this is true, behold the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable bountie and goodnes declared vnto vs in our God, what man is hee that is ſo peruerſe and voide of ſenſe and reaſon, which wil not be contented to place him ſelf there, where he thinketh his whole bleſſednes and felicitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth and lieth. Euen ſo likewiſe, when as become care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in ſeeking after the Lorde our God, it is a ſigne and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that we haue vnderſtoode nothing of that which he hath ſhewed vnto vs of his goodnes and mercie, and of all his fatherly affection, which is witneſſed vnto vs in the law, and in the holy ſcriptures. But becauſe it ſhall be no great adoe for a number of men, to make a countenance of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Lord, Dauid ſheweth that wee muſt not ſeeke him with our feete and handes, with the outward geſtures of the bodie alone, but with a true and pure affection. And therefore, he ſaieth, <hi>Bleſſed are they which ſeeke him with their whole heart.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I would not haue you to doe as the hypocrites do, which beare of religion with ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hand, no, I meane not ſo: but I would haue your loue to be ſound and true. As touching that ſaying, <hi>With their whole heart,</hi> it is to declare vnto vs, That God cannot away with parting of ſtakes, as we men many times doe: For we are well contented to beſtowe ſome part vpon God, and would be at free libertie to holde vs with the world, and to ſerue God by halfes. But Dauid teacheth vs here to ſerue him with our whole heart: to wit, in all integritie and ſoundnes, and not with two faces in one hood. He would not haue vs patted in ſunder, to ſaye, Well, I am contented to ſerue God, howbeit I would not that he ſhould require my whole ſeruice to him ſelfe: but that I might after ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb facs="tcp:7694:10"/>and followe my owne luſtes and pleaſures, that I might be at libertie to ſerue the worlde. No not ſo (ſaith he:) It muſt be brought into a true and perfect ſoundnes, and not to deuide man after ſuch a maner. True it is that wee ſhall neuer be able to ſeeke God with ſuch a perfection, but that it may be greatly ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: neither doth the holy ſcripture meane by this ſaying, <hi>With their whole heart,</hi> ful perfection, but only oppoſeth it ſelfe againſt the hypocriſie of a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of men, and which would be in vs al, were it not that God him ſelf did remedy &amp; help it. That is, we would with good wil ſerue God by halfes, if ſo be he would let vs alone with the reſt, to do what we thought good. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Wee ſhall haue very many which will not ſticke with God, to come to the Sermon on a Sunday, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the prayers of the faithfull, and to make ſome ſhewe of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and yet they would haue God to giue them free choiſe to do what they liſted at the reſt of the weeke after: or if they come to a Sermon oftener then on the Sunday, it ſeemeth to them that they haue done very well, that they are throughly diſcharged of their dueties if they tarrie there but one houre. But becauſe they might be ſet at more libertie, they will not ſticke to ſaye, that they will bee free from ſome one vice, one will ſay that he will be no whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, Another, that he will be no drunkarde, Another, that he wilbe no blaſphemer: &amp; yet euery one of theſe wil haue his particular vice, and thinke that God ought to beare with them, ſeeing that for his honour, and to do him pleaſure, they abſteined from ſome ſynne, and that they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed him in ſome point. But the ſcripture telleth vs that all this is nothing, but that euery one ought to examine him ſelfe throughly and in all pointes, and finding in him ſelfe any thing which is againſt the wil of God: to be vtterly diſpleaſed therewith, clerely to renounce it, and to deſire nothing but to be cleanſed thereof. See nowe, this is that perfection, whereof Dauid here ſpeaketh. Nowe let vs ſee what is the ſumme of the ſecond verſe, to weete, that wee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7694:10"/>ſhould doe nothing els but ſtudy in the lawe of God, not onely to knowe what is forbidden or commaunded, but to be certaine what maner of one GOD is towardes vs, and what affection he beareth vs, that we might put the truſt of our ſaluation in him, and call vpon his holy name. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is declared vnto vs, that when we haue taſted of the mercies of God, that hee hath certified vs of his loue and grace, that the ſame ought to ſtirre vs vp to ſeeke him, and to cleaue wholy vnto him, and to yelde our ſelues wholly to his ſeruice: and that not in the outward ſhewe, and in hypocriſie: but with a pure and ſound heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and not by halfes: ſo that there bee founde true ſoundnes and integritie, as before I haue touched. Now it followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Surely they woorke none iniquitie that walke in his waies.</hi> Firſt Dauid here ſheweth in this preſent verſe, what the cauſe is why all men abounde in euill and iniquitie: to weete, for ſo much as they will not bee ruled by the Lorde their God. See here the ſpring head of the outrages, of all the diſorder, and confuſions in the worlde, to weete, that God is preſt and ready to guyde and gouerne vs, but what? we may not awaye to beare his yoke, euery man refuſeth it, and wil be exempt from it. Loe here whereupon ariſeth our diſſolute and wanton life, to weete, bicauſe we will not ſuffer the authoritie which God hath ouer vs, to leade and guide vs, as he is alwayes ready to do, and as he alſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs by his lawe. Let this then be an Item for vs.</p>
            <p>And it followeth further. For Dauid meaneth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the woordes before ſpoken, to weete, howe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe that wee are bleſſed, that is, if wee keepe the teſtimonies of our GOD, and walke in his lawe. For, ſayeth hee, they which doe no wickedneſſe walke in his wayes: contrarywyſe, wee doe nothing but prouoke his heauy wrath and diſpleaſure againſt vs, in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſynne and iniquitie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:11"/>
            <p>when as God then ſtandeth againſt vs, &amp; becommeth our enemie, muſt not our life be vnhappy and accurſed? It can not be otherwiſe choſen. Heere then is one proofe of that which before hath beene ſaid: to wit, that our whole feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie conſiſteth in this, that God is our inſtructer and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and that we holde our ſelues too the doctrine which wee receiue from him And what is the reaſon? For loe, ſayth Dauid, they will abſtaine from euill dooing. When then wee abſtaine from dooing of euill, wee prouoke not God his heauy wrath againſt vs: and ſo let vs conclude, that herein conſiſteth our chiefe felicitie. Moreouer, here is to be noted, that as many as walke not in the law of God, cannot but runne into miſchiefe and deſtruction: yea how ſoeuer they thinke of their well doing, and perſuade them ſelues to liue holily and godly, yet hath God tolde them that it is cleane contrary. And here this parcell of ſcripture is worthie the marking, for hereby we may ſee the pryde of vs men, in that wee make all the worlde beleeue, that all things goe with vs as well as is poſsible, when as we follow our own fantaſies, being thus arrogant to ſay, whatſoeuer we do it is all well done. But behold what God (the onely iudge hereof) hath certainly ſet downe, which we can no way, repeale or call backe, neither ſhalbe poſsible to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted as we luſt, to wit, that no man can abſtaine from euill doing, but ſuch onely which walke after this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly doctrine. They then which walke after their owne pleaſure, muſt needes runne into euerlaſting perdition. Now then there are two maner of wayes wherein men doe erre. For one ſort exceede in open and moſt manifeſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions and ſinnes: and although they very well knowe that they are euill and wicked, yet take they leaue, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to followe them. As a whoremonger can not iuſtifie his wicked doing: no more can a theefe, a ſwearer, nor a dronkard. And yet it is ſo with them, that they alwaies giue them ſelues leaue to goe from better to worſe. Howbeit there is another maner of way of euill doing, which is mere d<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>agerous, and a great deale more to be feared, bicauſe it is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7694:11"/>more couert and ſecret, to weete, when as men will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them ſelues to be worthy of commendation, and that they thinke that there is none that can detecte or condemne them, hauing a fooliſh and diueliſh opinion which blindeth their eyes. Theſe men then (as it is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all hypocrites) may well iuſtifie them ſelues: but yet the caſe ſo ſtandeth, that God condemneth them, as here we may ſee. It remaineth now, that we vſe nothing for the whole rule and order of our life, but the law of God alone: for without it, all our life muſt needes bee diſſolute, and there ſhalbe nothing in it but confuſion and deſtruction, It followeth next after, <hi>That God hath commaunded vs too keepe diligently his precepts,</hi> That is, alwayes, according to the truth which Dauid holdeth. For it is very ſure, that God is ſo carefull ouer our ſaluation, that he procureth and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth it, as much as is poſsible for vs to deſire. No we if God be thus touched with vs, and beareth vs ſuch a good will and loue: let vs vnderſtand that when he chargeth vs to keepe his ordinances and preceptes, that he thereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth vnto vs, that the ſame is our whole bleſſedness and felicitie. And to prooue it to be ſo, God requireth not our ſeruice, bicauſe he hath ſome buſines for vs to do: For he hath not, nor needeth any helpe of his creattres. When then we are not able do that which he commaundeth vs, we can neither do good nor hurt vnro our creator. What is it that moueth him to bee ſo carefull ouer vs as he is, and what is it that pricketh and thruſteth vs foreward to keepe his commandements? Surely, ſince neither his profite nor gaine leadeth him to be thus careful, doutles he reſpecteth onely our ſaluation. By this we may conclude, that there is none other bleſſednes which we can enioy, but to walke in his lawe, as he hath before ſaid. But in the meane while we may ſee how villanous and wicked a thing our vnthankfulnes is: for God ſheweth not vnto vs onely in a worde what is our duetie to doe, but vſeth alſo a familiar &amp; gentle doctrine, to drawe vs vnto him. And afterward he exhorteth vs, because he ſeeth vs to be very cold and vntoward. And
<pb facs="tcp:7694:12"/>for the ſelfſame cauſe he vſeth much diuerſitie, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it diligently as we ſee: to the ende wee might pretende no excuſe of ignorance, when we haue nor performed that which he hath ſet downe vnto vs by his lawe: but that we ſhould be conuinced of malice, and that wee might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and knowe that wee are well worthie of euerlaſting cond<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>enation. And ſo much the more ought we thoroughly to marke this doctrine, where it is declared vnto vs, that no excuſe ſhall ſerue vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as euery of vs outrageth ſo much and followeth his owne luſt: ſeeing that God hath preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, and that he hath declared vnto vs, that the right rule to walke by, is to follow his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes: neither that he hath done the ſame ſlightly, but that hee hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and continued therein, as much as was poſsible for him to do. Thirdly, that by this meane hee hath ſhewed vnto vs his great loue towardes vs, and what care he hath of our welfare &amp; life. Dauid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goeth on forward, &amp; ſaith. <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keepe thy Statutes.</hi> Here Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid pricketh him ſelfe fowarde, and ſheweth the deſire hee hath to come to that bleſſednes and felicitie whereof hee hath ſpoken before. And we muſt be ſure to obſerue this order, for it is not enough for vs to vnderſtand and knowe wherein our felicitie and bleſſednes conſiſteth, and the way to come thereunto, as God hath appointed vs: but we muſt alſo enter into our ſelues. For euery man muſt thinke thus with him ſelfe. What maner of man am I? Seeing my God is ſo louing and mercifull tha the ſeeketh me, &amp; that he requireth nothing els of me but that I ſhould come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, is it reaſon that I ſhould ſit ſtill? ſhall I become a blocke? ſhall I become a ſenſles and witles creature? ſhall I not be moued with ſuch fauour and grace as my GOD ſheweth vnto me, and maketh me to feele.</p>
            <p>See here what Dauid meaneth to teach vs in this verſe, O that my wayes were made ſo direct, that I might keepe thy commaundements. When as he ſpeaketh of his waies, he meaneth al the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his life, for the life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Waye: And that not without cauſe, for all our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7694:12"/>thoughtes and affections, are as wayes, and as our foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteppes. Nowe he ſayeth, O that my wayes were made ſo direct, that I might keepe thy commandementes. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declareth, that a faithful ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after he hath knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this mercie of God in guiding our life, ought to enter into him ſelfe, and thinke that there is neither reaſon nor wiſedome in him how to gouerne him ſelfe: but that all proceedeth from the good will and louing kindnes of the Lorde. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens then that wee are ſo enclined to roue in our owne wayes hether and thether, by reaſon of the fooliſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and vaine confidence which we haue of our own wiſedome, let vs vſe ſuch remedy as God hath aſsigned vs: to weete, that we forſake our ſelues, and treade vnder foote this carnall reaſon which deceiueth vs: that wee ſet at naught all our luſtes and vngodly affections that God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may beare rule, and our life be guided according to his his lawe.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>Then ſhould I not bee confounded, when I haue respect to all thy commaundementes.</hi> Here Dauid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth him ſelfe in the doctrine next before: for hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth what the marke is whereat he aymeth. O Lorde, ſayeth hee, when as thou ſhalt doe me that good, that I may be directed according to thy word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhal neuer be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. When Dauid now hath ſuch a deſire, he there by right well declareth, that euery man ought to be careful &amp; to endeuour himſelf theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, or els he ſhall neuer obey the will of God, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that there are ſo many gainſayings in our fleſh &amp; nature, as is moſt pitifull to thinke vpon. For looke how many our affections &amp; thoughtes are, we haue euen ſo many enemies rebelling againſt God, and which hinder vs to walke after his will. Wee ought therefore to praye vnto him that he will holde vs in, that he may be our maiſter, &amp; we his vaſſails. Moreouer, let vs conſider wel of that which is here ſpoken, to weete, that in keeping the c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God, we ſhall neuer be confounded. By this he doth vs to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that ſo many as followe their owne luſtes &amp; fantaſies, which looke this way &amp; that way,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:13"/>and do imagine them ſelues a marke, &amp; forge them ſelues ſuch away as ſeemeth good in their owne ſight, that they ſhalbe confounded and deceiued. No doute when men do that which beſt liketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, they ſtreightwayes thinke all things ſhall goe ſo well with them as is poſsible to bee wiſhed, glorying in their owne vaine imaginations: but what followeth thereof? God confoundeth them in their owne arrogancie wherwith they were puffed vp for a time: Woulde wee eſchewe this confuſion of the vnbeleeuing perſons? Let vs haue an eye to the commaundementes of God: to wit, let our eyes be ſetled on them, and looke not on our owne reaſon, nor of our naturall ſenſe, neither yet of any other thing that lieth in our owne power, which may turne vs away from them. And it is a neceſſary point for vs to be enfourmed thereof. For as often as men will giue them ſelues leaue to imagine and thinke what they liſt to haue done, there ſhall a thouſand thoughtes for cloſe their mindes, and ſo will turne them away from God, and wholy eſtraunge them from the doctrine of ſaluation. And for this cauſe Dauid declareth that there is but one onely meane, to wit, that we ſhould wholy ſettle our eyes vpon the Lawe of GOD, without turning away from it either on this ſide or on that, as commonly and vſually we doe. Afterward he goeth on and ſayeth, <hi>I will prayſe thee with an vpright heart: when I ſhal learne the iudgementes of thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes.</hi> Dauid ſheweth in this verſe how we may praiſe the Lord our God, and that is continually following the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his matter. For wee muſt all confeſſe that our life is miſerable, if it tende not to the prayſe and glorifying of God. Let vs now ſee how we may prayſe him: We muſt be exerciſed in his iudgementes, that is, in the rule which hee hath ſet downe vnto vs. For this word, <hi>Iudgements,</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that wee are taught and inſtructed of that which wee haue to do For our life is outragious if we paſſe the limits and boundes which he hath appointed vs: and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, we keepe a true vprightnes in obeying of him. Now then he ſayeth, that when he ſhall haue learned the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7694:13"/>iudgementes of God, that then he will thanke him with an vnfained heart. By this hee ſignifieth vnto vs, that although men perſuade them ſelues to loue GOD as much as is poſsible, neuertheles that it is but fained, vntill ſuch time as they are vnfainedly inſtructed in the lawe. And thus much for that. Moreouer, here is to be noted, that that is not all which wee haue learned that God ſheweth vnto vs in his word: but Dauid ſpeaketh here of an inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which taketh roote, and is ſettled and abideth in the heart of a man, according to that which hath heretofore beene ſaid. For a number may imagine of their own braine what the lawe of God is, but in the meane while it ſtandeth ſo with them, that when we beholde their life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, it appeareth that they haue profited no whit at all in his ſchoole. It is meete therefore that out heart be brought to the ſchoole of God, to weete, that whatſoeuer hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, it may bee throughly imprinted and engrauen within. And this is that maner of learning, whereof Dauid here ſpeaketh. For if we haue beene exerciſed in this ſort, that we haue holden the doctrine and law of God, we may very well glorifie his bleſſed name: to weete, we may truly praiſe him as he hath commaunded vs.</p>
            <p>When he ſaieth, <hi>I will keepe thy Statutes:</hi> that is, That he is ſo reſolued and confirmed in the doctrine of the lawe, that he hath ouercome all the affections and luſtes of the fleſh and the worlde, which might reſiſt and hinder him in the ſeruice of God. He hath ſayd before, O that my wayes were made ſo direct. He deſireth, as a man which when he cannot haue that which he wiſheth for, is in great paine and trauell. It behoueth vs alſo to poure out ſuch ſighes &amp; groanes, conſidering the rebellion of our fleſh, which is ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the righteouſnes of God, that all our thoughtes and affections (as is aboueſaid) are ſo many gaineſayinges, that they turne vs cleane away from his obeyſaunce. Wee muſt therefore ſaye with Dauid, Alas: howe is it poſsible that I ſhould be euer able to come to the perfect ſeruing of my God? to truſt vpon him, and wholy to ſettle my ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:14"/>vpon that rule and order which hee hath ſet downe vnto me? Loe I ſay, theſe ſhould be our wiſhes and deſires. But this is not ſufficient enough, to haue a deſire that we might ſerue God.</p>
            <p>But there is yet much more, as when we ſhall deſire that God will puſhe vs forward and ſtirre vs vp thereto, and yet we muſt not ſtay there neither. What muſt we then do? Let vs ſtep forth with Dauid and proteſt, that we will keepe the commaundements of God: to wit, when wee haue fought againſt our inordinate affections, and that wee are aſſured to haue victorie ouer them, that we then make this concluſion: God ſhall ſo conduct me, that I ſhalbe able to keepe his Statutes. As for the reſt, bicauſe we can not haue this as of our ſelues, we are alwayes to pray as Dauid did:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Lord forſake me not vtterly.</hi> For if God withhold his holy hand from vs, alas what ſhall become of vs? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for vs to haue one good deſire or thought in vs? No, it is impoſsible, but we ſhall wholy decline to all euill and miſchiefe, yea and we ſhall become his enemies and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. We muſt therefore, hauing all our refuge from God, beſeeche him with Dauid, that he wil not forſake vs. When he ſaith, <hi>O Lord forſake me not ouerlong,</hi> He ſignifieth vnto vs, that God many times ſuffereth vs to go wrong, &amp; ſuffereth vs to fall, or els to ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble. And why doth he ſo? Becauſe hee would humble vs: for what is he which goeth not out of the waye, or at the leaſt halteth not, and which oftentimes falleth not flat downe? But yet for all that hee would not haue vs diſcouraged. When then we ſee our weakenes, and that there are many faultes and imperfections in vs. Let vs beſeech the Lorde our God that hee will not forſake vs for euer: for there is no difficultie which Dauid woulde not but that we ſhoulde knowe, and hee knew a great many of faultes in himſelfe: But yet he hoped that God would not forſake him for euer. And he knewe alſo that though he happened oftentimes to fall, yet that he would relieue him by his grace.</p>
            <p>And this is his meaning alſo what we muſt doe: for we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7694:14"/>knowe this, that there is no man which wholy keepeth the lawe of God: we are al tranſgreſſors thereof, we are all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinners. We muſt therefore runne vnto our good God, and beſeeche him that when we are fallen, that he wil relieue vs through his fatherly goodnes, as hee is alwayes ready to doe, and that he hath promiſed hee will gouerne vs, in ſupporting of vs, vntill ſuch time as he hath deſpoyled vs of all the imperfections of our fleſhe. And according to this holy doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the face of our good God in confeſsing our faultes, beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him to giue vs a taſt that we may feele what a pleaſure he doth vs, when he communicateth his word familiarly among vs, and that hee will inſtruct vs thereby, not onely to vnderſtand to diſcerne betwixt good and euill: but that we may alſo be ſure and certaine of his loue and good will towardes vs: to the ende that we liuing vnder his charge and conduction, might runne vnto him, that in the middeſt of the miſeries and wretchednes of this world, he will make vs bleſſed, that wee may come to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bliſſe, and the glorie immortall, which hath beene purchaſed for vs once for all by our Lord &amp; ſauiour Chriſte Ieſus his ſonne. And that when he hath once ſet vs into the right waye, that he would keepe vs therein more and more, vntill the time that he hath brought vs into his heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. That not onely, &amp;c.</p>

               </gap> life as it becommeth vs, to haue it rightly gouerned, and to be pure and ſimple, we muſt holde that way which GOD hath ſet before vs. For wee muſt not truſt vnto our owne wits. Neither frame &amp; faſhion vnto our ſelues ſuch a way as ſhall to vs ſeeme beſt: but to ſuffer God to rule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct vs, and to obey him ſimply and playnely. To bee ſhort, Dauid ſignifyeth vnto vs, that all the wiſedome and perfection of our life, is to followe GOD, and cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his will. True it is, that this ſentence at the firſt ſight may ſeeme to vs too to common, and as it were more then nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. For we will ſay, what is he that knoweth not this, &amp; wil not confeſſe it, I will not deny but that it is an ordinary thing to confeſ it: But in the mean while, how few are ther which are perſuaded of that which is here ſpoken: or if we imagine ſuch a thing in our head, where is the practiſe of it? I feare me, we ſhal finde it in a very ſmale number of vs. Let vs not therefore thinke that this rule which the ſpirit of God hath ſet before vs, is in vaine, for it is for the amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our life according to his worde, and to make vs to vnderſtande, that without it, all is but doung, &amp; filth, that we haue al erred, &amp; that we hold no way, although we think al to the contrary. But we are to conſider, why he eſpecially ſpeaketh here, of a yong man. For we are ſure that God hath geuen his law aſwel for the great as the ſmal, for the olde as the yong: that when we ſhal begin to be taught it euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our youth, we muſt hold &amp; continue it to the graue. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then doth Dauid ſtraine this doctrine of the lawe too yong men? It is not for that it reacheth not vnto the aged:
<pb facs="tcp:7694:16"/>but there are twoo reaſons why he ſo ſpake. We knowe the hoat affection that is in youth, and that there is ſuche an heate in vs, as that it ſeemeth it can no way be kept in.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it is a harde matter, too repreſſe the hoat and exceeding boyling affections of yongmen: Dauid eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſheweth, that the word of God is the beſt remedy to repreſſe the ſame. As if he ſhould haue ſaide, It is very true, that yong men are recheles and do erre, yea like vnto wilde beaſtes which caſte no doubtes, ſo hoate and furious, as that it is almoſt impoſsible to bring them to any good paſſe, or yet to reſtrayne them. For when we thinke to haue ſureſt hold on them, then are they fartheſt off, but if they ſhalbe aduiſed and counſelled to be ordered and gouerned by God, no doubt of it they wilbe greatly daunted. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their paſsions and affections doe greatly exceed, yet ſhall a man ſee in them ſome modeſtie, and a quiet and courteous behauiour. The miſchiefe then is, that yong men will not be ſubiect to God: for if they woulde, they ſhould finde a good meane in his word, yea, and the ſame very ſufficient, to remedy all their vices. And it tendeth to this end, to declare vnto vs what vertue is in the worde of God, euen to ſuppreſſe the moſt outragious paſsions that may poſsibly be within vs. And thus much for the firſt point. The ſecond reaſon is, that Dauid his meaning is chiefly to: ſhew vnto the yonger ſort that they had great neede to be held ſhort: for otherwiſe they woulde exceede more &amp; more in all miſchief: for their nature is the rather more &amp; more enclined to euil, bicauſe it hath little aduice and ſmall wiſedome. His minde therefore is to aduertiſe them of this neceſsitie, becauſe they ſhould be more careful to beſtowe their ſtudy vppon the woorde of God. And to be brief, his meaning is to aduertiſe the whole worlde in general, that we ought betimes to enter into the ſchoole of God, if we wilbe taught according to his will. We know what Solomon ſaith in the booke of Eccleſiaſtes, that wee muſt not tarry vntill we come to old worne yeeres,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.2.</note> &amp; then to remember God &amp; thinke vpon him. But that we ſhould beginne ſo ſoone as God hath giuen vs wit and diſcretion,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7694:16"/>and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue it vnto the ende. Loe here, a doctrine which ought throughly to be marked of vs, for wee ſee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the ſpringhead of all the exceſſe and wantonnes, which do nowe reigne, and haue in al ages reigned in the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, bicauſe that God is not obeyed, for if that were ſo, we ſhould haue a bridle to keepe vs in awe and in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo that we would ſuffer our ſelues to be ordred by the doctrine which is conteined in the holy ſcripture. If we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would humble our ſelues and be ſubiect to God as to our Maiſter, all things ſhould be aſwell directed as wee could poſsibly wiſhe. But why do we not ſo? The world forſooth wil not obey God as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it, neither wil it he brought to this reaſon. Behold then the cauſe why we ſee all things ſo confuſed as they are. So it is that we are altogether inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, ſeeing that our God ſo offreth him ſelfe vnto vs, &amp; declareth vnto vs that if we will followe his worde, that all things ſhall go well with vs, that our way ſhalbe pure and cleane, and that our life ſhalbe true perfectnes it ſelfe. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God giueth ſuch a teſtimonie vnto his law, al mouthes muſt be ſtopped, and we muſt be caſt down hedlong, when as we know that we thus rebelled againſt our God, who is alwayes ready truedy to guide vs. And thus much for this. Moreouer, if our affections be ſo contrary, that our luſtes &amp; affections be like wilde beaſtes, that we cannot repreſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: let vs know that our God will giue power and ſtrength to his word that we may be ioyned with him, if ſo be that wee will direct our ſelues to that marke. And to proue it to bee ſo, he here ſpeaketh eſpecially of the corruptions of youth, which (as I haue already declared) are more exceſsiue and diſordered then they are in the aged. But ſo it is that both great and ſmall might very wel be brought to this paſſe, to ſuppreſſe their inordinate affections and luſtes, if ſo be they would giue that honour to God which vnto him appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that is, if they would follow his word.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, wee are here to note the exhortation which we haue already touched, to wit, that it is Dauid his meaning to manifeſt vnto vs that wee ought betimes to bee Gods ſchollers, and to ſuffer him to rule vs, and to
<pb facs="tcp:7694:17"/>continue and holde vs in this ſtudy all the daies of our life. Let vs not then tarry vntill we come to the graues brinke to become wiſe in this behalfe, as wee ſee theſe ſcorners, which make them ſelues mery, and outrage in mocking of God, ſaying, Well ſir, wee ſhall haue leiſure to repent time enough. For if we may haue but one hearty ſighe, care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Sithens then this is moſt ſure that it is Satan which eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus greeuouſly to abuſe the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God: let vs bew are that we be not ſo bewitched. But let vs follow that which is here ſet downe, to weete, that wee may be Gods ſchollers euen from our youth. And aboue all things let vs conſider, that yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue here a ſpeciall leſſon to learne, as before hath beene touched. For Dauid here declareth vnto them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.22.</note> that they haue a great deale more neede to bee reſtrained, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of the reſt. It is very true that we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alwayes, euen as yong childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Yea, I ſay that the elder ſort of greater experience, and ſuch as appeare graue and wiſe to the world, are without all dout before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of God very fooles and idiotes. We heare alſo what Dauid confeſſeth of him ſelfe in an other place, where he ſaieth, that he was like a calfe, and a beaſt without reaſon or wiſedome. And if it went ſo with him, with him I ſay, that was ſo excellent a Prophet, what ſhall become of vs? I ſay then that the elder ſort ought greatly to profite in this ſchoole of Gods wiſedome: and yet this is no vaine thing, whereunto Dauid here eſpecially exhorteth the yonge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And why ſo? For as I haue already ſayde, this age is ſo without any conſideration, as nothing can be more, and is much ſubiect to the temptations of Satan, and of the fleſh. And on the other ſide, ouer and beſides that, there is neither iudgement nor wiſedome in yongmen, in ſo much that they are ſo ſtirred vp with heate, as that their boiling affections breake out: Yet in ſteade of hauing ſome mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, &amp; to take in good part the admonitions which might be giuen them, they will be the more loftie and ſtubborne, which might take better occaſion to be more grieued in beeing reprehended or rebuked.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:7694:17"/>
            <p>And that this is true, we ſee at this day howe all things are out of order. This is ſure, that the true vertue which ſhould be in youth, is modeſtie: and that the younger ſorte ought to knowe that ſince they are not furniſhed with wiſdome and diſcretion as the elder ſorte are, they ought to heare them, and not to be giuen ouer to their owne will and wit. This is the moſte principall wiſedome that ought to bee in young men. But what? they are at this day paſt all ſhame. By this we may ſee that the worlde is euen as it were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſperate, and that we are growen to the fulneſſe of all miſchiefe and iniquitie. For wee ſhall ſee theſe beaſtly and graceleſſe boyes and wenches, which ſcarſely are able too wype their owne noſes, as we ſay, yea and that might yet be vnder the rod ten yeeres, like peeuiſh wretches as they are, that when ſo euer they ſhalbe ſpoken vnto, wil make no reckoning of whatſouer is ſaid, but poute and mowe at it, counterfaiting the very Apes and Monkeyes, as dayly wee may ſee. And when we ſee ſuch extreame pride in this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what ſhall wee ſay but that Satan hath euen poſſeſſed them? and that they will ſhewe themſelues as in deede they are, to weere, without all amendment? So then, this point is ſo much the more to be wel conſidered of, when as hee ſaith: <hi>Wherwithall ſhall a young man addreſſe his way? by taking heede thereto according to thy worde.</hi> True it is, that a great many which haue neede heere to be tolde this geere, care not for filling of their eares with any ſuch matter, they haue knowledge inough too keepe them ſelues from the Church: For they haue the thing which they deſire when they may be at the Tauerne, playing and Dauncing. But what? It is certaine that this doctrine will not leaue them vncondemned when as God cryeth vnto them, as hee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth by Solomon,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.20.21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22.23.</note> where he bringeth in Wiſedome ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I haue cryed out, and put foorth my voyce in the ſtreetes, I haue bidden both great &amp; ſmall, to the end that men might heare mee, and none hath vouchſafed too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me, ne yet to giue me lodging. When God declareth vnto vs, that our life ſhall be well ordered if wee keepe his
<pb facs="tcp:7694:18"/>word, ſurely as many as flye from this doctrine and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, ſhall render an account at the laſt day, becauſe God hath called them. And alſo becauſe they haue not only bin deafe, but alſo haue added this miſchiefe, to flye from the admonitions, which Gods word admoniſhed them off, to bring them againe into the way of ſaluation, from whiche they were ſtrayed. It is eſpecially ſayd, <hi>Tea, by taking heede thereto according to thy worde.</hi> Dauid his meaning is heere to expreſſe vnto vs, that we may make our ſelues beleeue, that we haue wiſedome and diſcretion inough. But yet it ſhall profire vs no whit at all, without we will bee gouerned and ruled by God, according to that which hath beene before ſaide. Nowe it followeth:</p>
            <q>With my whole hearte haue I ſought thee: let mee not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from thy Commaundementes.</q>
            <p>Dauid heere maketh a notable confeſſion, which is not common to all men, That hee bath ſought God with his whole heart. For although we haue a deſire to goe to God, yet it is ſo feeble as is lamentable, ſeeing we are with drawn with ſo many vanities, by reaſon the world hath ſuch domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer vs, and yet ought not to retire our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any good deuotion, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we haue had a through feeling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. There are very few of vs that are able to ſay with the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet Dauid, that we haue ſought God with our whole hart: to wit, with ſuch integritie and pureneſſe, that we haue not turned away from that marke, as from the moſt principall thing of our ſaluation. It is very true, that Dauid had not yet any ſuch perfection, but that hee ſlacked in the fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prickings of the fleſhe, and went back.</p>
            <p>Saint Paule alſo confeſſeth that hee went too God as it were halting, that he did not that good which hee woulde &amp; deſired,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19.20.</note> but that he was encompaſſed with his naturall vices, to doe the euill which he condemned. Dauid was not without ſuch temptations: but how ſoeuer it was, it is moſt certaine that the principall matter wherto he bent himſelf, was to ſerue God. Now as I haue before ſaid, we are all farr from this example. For as many of vs as at this day are beſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7694:18"/>affected, may be letted and hindered by a number of vices, vaine cares of this world, &amp; with luſts &amp; deſires of the fleſh, that if we ſhould remoue our foote euery day too goe one pace forward, it were much and yet it may come ſo to paſſe often times, that we would drawe back againe to the place from whence we came. And yet notwithſtanding, Dauid, after hee had proteſted that he ſought God with his whole hearte, beſought God that he would not ſuffer him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from his Commaundementes. Heereby let vs ſee what great neede we haue to call vpon God, too the ende he may holde vs with a mightie ſtronge hand. Yea, and although hee hath already mightely put too his helping hand, and we alſo knowe that he hath beſtowed vppon vs great and manifolde graces: yet is not this all: But there are ſo many vices and imperfections in our nature, and wee ſo feeble and weake, as that we haue very greate neede day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray vnto him, yea and that more and more, that hee will not ſuffer vs to decline from his Commaundementes. For although Dauid proteſted that hee ſought God with all his heart, neuer theleſſe, hee addeth, yet ſuffer mee not O Lorde too goe wronge from thy Commaundementes: What ſhall we doe then? Let vs alſo learne to walke care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: for ſince hee is the God which giueth vs that good minde to wil, and that alſo giueth vs the power too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and all of his meere fauour and grace: wee ought (ſayth Saint Paule) to walke in feare, and to keepe good watch, too the ende that Satan taketh not vs vnprouided,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.</note> and that he enter not within vs.</p>
            <p>And loe what is the cauſe that wee haue ſeene ſome men which haue made a greate ſhewe of holineſſe for a time, and haue ſeemed too bee more like Angels then men, which at length haue growne too outrage: and haue ſo greatly exceeded their boundes, as that GOD euen forſooke them, like deſperate men. And whence then proceedeth this? Verily from their owne ſecurytie and negligence, becauſe they thought them ſelues to bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfect, But Paule is c1eane contrary to this, for thus he
<pb facs="tcp:7694:19"/>ſayth, I haue not attained as yet to that ful perfection, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſe I haue done what in melyeth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 12.</note> When he ſayth, I haue doone what in me lyeth, he declareth that there was that humilitie in him, whereof he ſpake in the place before by me already alleaged: and this humilitie importeth, that we ſhould call vpon God as Dauid did, as he ſheweth vnto vs heere in this place.</p>
            <p>It followeth: <hi>I haue hid my promiſe within my heart: that I might not ſinne againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Dauid ſpeaketh after this manner, I haue hid thy word or promiſe in mine heart, he wet declareth, that if we haue but only a wandring knowledge, that the ſame wil not holde vs in, but that the Deuil hath by and by woone vpon vs to oppreſſe vs, with temptations, and in the ende to caſt vs downe hedlong. What muſt wee then doe? It is not inough that we haue beene at church, and heard what hath bin there ſaid vnto vs, and that euery of vs hath mumbled vp vnto himſelfe ſome one thing or another, but the word of God muſt be ſetled in vs and be hid in our heart, to wit, that it may there be reſiaunt and continually abyding: and to haue receiued it with ſuch an affection, as that it bee as it were imprinted in vs. If this be not ſo, ſinne will reigne in vs, for it hath by nature his habitation with vs: For all our ſenſes are wicked and corrupt, all our willes and deſires are enemyes vnto God, vnleſſe Gods woord be wel hidden in our heartes. Moreouer, we are to vnderſtande, that Dauid heere vaunted not him ſelfe of his owne power &amp; ſtrength, as though he were in admiration thereof: but the ſpirite of God ſpeaking by his mouth, entendeth to giue vs a glaſſe, wherein we muſt be confirmed, to weete, that we muſt not haue onely our eares beaten with the Doctrine of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and receiue it in our braine: but that it ſhould be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in our heart, to wit, that we ſhould lay it vp as in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure houſe. For this ſaying, to hide, importeth that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſtudyed not to be ambitious to ſet foorth him ſelfe, and to make a glorious ſhew before men: but that he had God for a witneſſe of that ſecret deſire which was within him.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7694:19"/>Hee neuer looked to worldly creatures, but being content that he had ſo great a Treaſure, he knewe full wel that God who had giuen it him, would ſo ſurely and ſafely garde it, as that it ſhould not be layd open to Satan to be taken away. Saint Paule alſo declareth vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19.</note> that the cheſt wherein this treaſure muſt be hid, is a good conſcience. For it is ſaid, that many beeing voyde of this good conſcience, haue loſt alſo their faith, and haue beene robbed thereof. As if a man ſhoulde forſake his goods and put them in aduenture, with out ſhutting of any dore, it were an eaſy matter for theeues to come in and to reaue and ſpoyle him of all: Euen ſo, if wee leaue at randon too Satan the Treaſure which GOD hath giuen vnto vs in his word, without it be hidden in this good conſcience, and in the very bottome of our hearte as Dauid heere ſpeaketh, we ſhalbe ſpoiled thereof. He addeth immediatly after:</p>
            <q>Bleſſed art thou O Lorde: O teach me thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>After he had fayd, I haue ſought thee with mine whole heart: hee addeth, <hi>Bleſſed art thou O Lorde: O teach mee thy Statutes.</hi> Dauid ſheweth in this verſe, that the requeſt which he made here afore, is not founded or grounded of any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite or deſert which he pretended to haue. In very deede, at the firſt ſight it might be ſaid, that Dauid ment that God would not for ſake him, becauſe he had ſought him, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon conclude that man muſt firſt beginne to goe on, too preuent Gods grace, and then that God wil afterward aide him. Yee ſee here what men may imagine, but this is not Dauids meaning and purpoſe. And to proue it to be ſo, it is moſte ſure, hee attributeth it not to his owne power and ſtrength, that he had ſought God with his whole heart, for we muſt firſt be touched with the ſpirite of God, when as we haue any ſuch affection. And why ſo? For by nature we haue all ſtrayed from God, and all our force, power, and ſtudy, bende them ſelues to eſtraunge vs from him. And therefore wee muſt come vnto him in ſuch ſorte as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto vs in many places of the holy Scripture. Dauid then was preuented already by Gods grace, and hee onely
<pb facs="tcp:7694:20"/>requireth of God to continue the ſame in him which hee hath begunne, for he knewe right well that hee had greate neede thereof. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, I know very wel O Lord, that thou haſt already mightily put too thy helping hand by thy holy ſpirit, when as I ſought thee: in very deed I had neuer done it, without I had beene conducted by thy holy hand, neither is this yet inough, except thou continue the ſame in me: &amp; when thou ſhalt ſo doe O Lord, all praiſe and glory ſhalbe thine for the ſame, becauſe thou haſt done it of thy meere fauour and grace.</p>
            <p>By this then we may ſee, that Dauid heere meaneth not to glorifie himſelfe as beeing puffed vp with his owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and merites: But becauſe God deſerueth to be bleſſed and exalted to the end that we ſhoulde render vnto him all honor and glory. See now wherefore hee aſſureth himſelfe that he will teach him, and that he ſhall be more and more confirmed in that doctrine which he hath already learned. For when he ſayth, Teach me thy Statutes O Lord: it was not becauſe that he was altogither rude and ignorant, that hee coulde bee nowe a Nouice, which was a Prophet, had charge to inſtruct others, and was alſo a King. Dauid then ſpake not as one that was vnlearned: but hee knewe well i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that all this was not ſufficient, without hee profited ſtill more and more. Now if Dauid ſpake after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I beſeech you what ought we to do? When ſoeuer then that we would obtaine this grace at Gods hands, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in his ſtatutes, let vs bring this reaſon vnto him, &amp; ground our ſelues vpon this, to wit, that he be bleſſed and prayſed. And aboue all things, let vs vnderſtand the great neede we haue heereof: that is, that although wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beene inſtructed in the holy Scripture, that wee muſt be Scholers vnto the ende, and too pray vnto God dayly to encreaſe our fayth: I meane ſuch chiefely as are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too preach the woorde. True it is, that it were a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous great preſumption for any man too come into the Pulpit, and to vſurpe the office of a Preacher, excepte hee were well ſtudyed in the holy Scripture. But ſo it is that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7694:20"/>wee goe vpp in the Pulpit dayly, with this condition too learne, when as we teach others. And beeing thus, I doo not onely ſpeake that I might bee hearde: but for mine owne parte I muſt alſo bee the Scholer of God, and that the word which proceedeth from my mouth might profite my ſelfe likewiſe, otherwiſe curſed am I. Let vs then note this by the way, that they which are moſte perfecte and ready in the Scriptures, are arrogaunt fooles, except they acknowledge that they had neede too haue God for their Schoolemaiſter all the dayes of their life, and to bee more and more confirmed, after the example of Dauid.</p>
            <p>In very deede theſe things very well deſerue to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of more at large, but that I reſpecte one thing, that in handling of this Pſalme by parcels, it may be imprinted the better in our memory. For as I haue ſayde in the firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which I made on Sunday laſt paſt, that it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, that the ſpirite of God would haue this Pſalme to be made according to the Letters of an A.B.C. becauſe euery one ſhould learne it as perfectly as their Pater Noſter, as wee commonly ſay. Seeing then that our Lorde God would that we ſhoulde haue this Pſalme perfectly, and for our owne vſe, it is alſo good and neceſſary that the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of it be pure and ſimple, and ſo to follow the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the text, as that wee might vnderſtand as it were worde by worde, whatſoeuer is contayned therein. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth now, that euery of vs vnderſtand what hath byn handled, without looking after any longer repetition. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe I will ſo endeuour my ſelfe to be ſhorte, as that (God willing) the woords which I ſhal vtter ſhall not bee very darke, eſpecially to thoſe which be attentiue.</p>
            <p>It followeth: <hi>With my lippes haue I declared all the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of thy mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dauid ſheweth heere the accorde which ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God &amp; vs: to wit, that god hath inſtructed vs, &amp; when we haue heard that which hath bin ſaide vnto vs, that euery one ſhould ſay Amen, &amp; that there bee a ſweete harmony &amp; accorde betwixt him &amp; vs, without iar or contradiction.
<pb facs="tcp:7694:21"/>Loe heere in ſumme that which is ment in this verſe. Nowe in the meane while we haue to note, that Dauid declareth that he contenteth not himſelfe alone with following of God and cleauing vnto him: but that he laboureth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth aſmuch as in him lyeth, to ſtirre vpp his neighboures likewiſe, and to bring it ſo to paſſe, as that God might bee ſerued with a common accorde, throughout the whole worlde. He then that will haue a true zeale to honor God, will not thinke onely of himſelfe, but will haue an eye eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and ſeeke by all meanes poſſible that he can, too redreſſe thoſe which are wickedly giuen, to ſtirre vpp thoſe which are colde and negligent, to ſtrengthen thoſe which are weake and feeble, to entertaine thoſe which are already in a good forwardneſſe and to make them more forwarde. Loe heere whereunto all the faithfull haue an eye. For the Lord our God teacheth vs vpon this condition, that euery of vs thinke not onely particularly of himſelfe, but that wee ſhould alſo haue a mutuall care one of another, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we ſhall haue this zeale, let vs vnderſtand, that God hath created the whole worlde vppon this condition, that we all ſhould be obedient vnto him. But we muſt wel way the order that is heere ſet downe: For Dauid beginneth not with this ſentence, That with his lippes he hath tolde of all the Iudgementes of the Lordes mouth. For he hath ſayde before, that he hath hid them in his hart. The thing which Dauid ſaid to be hid in his hearte, he ſoone after declareth it with his mouth, wherin he ſheweth that euery of vs ought to beginne with himſelfe. When wee meane too inſtruct and teach our neighbours, we muſt not ſay vnto them, Go you before: but, Come next after me, or elſe harde by me: and hauing care all to goe the right way, wee ſhould all at-once labour to goe togither to our God, to be conioyned vnto him in true fayth. And I ſpeake it too this ende, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee ſhall ſee many who in this behalfe can very well prattle and babble, and would ſeeme to be the greateſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the world. But what of all this? Let vs in the meane time looke into their liues and conuerſation, and wee ſhall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7694:21"/>finde in them nothing but infection and ſtench, nothinge elſe but mocking of God in all they goe about and doe.</p>
            <p>We muſt therfore followe the order which Dauid here holdeth: to witte, that the word of God bee hid as a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the bottome of our heart: and afterward when as we ſhall haue this affection, let vs indeuour our ſelues to draw others alſo thereto, and goe altogither with one accorde to honour our Lorde God: and that hee which hath beene better taught then any of his neighboures haue beene, let him confeſſe that hee is ſo much the more beholden and bound vnto God, to doo that which is heere ſhewed vnto vs by Dauid. For although wee are not all Prophetes as hee was, yet for all that, this was ſpoken to vs all in general,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Collo.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13.</note> Admoniſh ye one another. Saint Paule ſpeaketh it too all the faithfull and to all Chriſtians. And that we ſhould alſo knowe that this belongeth and appertaineth too vs: and chiefely as I haue before ſayde, that they which are moſte forwarde, ſhoulde lay foorth the grace which was giuen vnto them for the common building vpp of the Church, and inſtruction of their neighbours. It followeth:</p>
            <q>I haue had as great delight in the way of thy teſtimonyes, as in all manner of riches.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid declareth that hauing wayned him ſelfe from his earthly affections, wherwithall we are ouer great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intangled, he wholly traueleth to come to God. For it is impoſſible for vs too taſte the ſweeteneſſe conteyned in the worde of God, to take pleaſure in this doctrine of our ſaluation, and to bee altogither giuen therevnto, before ſuch time as we haue cut off from vs, all our wicked luſtes and affections which reigne too too much in our mortall bodyes. It is like as if a man woulde haue land to bringe foorth Corne, which were altogither full of thornes and weedes. Or what is he that would haue a Vine growe vpon ſtones and rockes, wherein is no moyſture? For what is the ſtate of the nature of man? Forſoth it is as barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> land as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibly can be. What are al our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but buſhes, thornes, and weedes, which choke and make all the good ſeede of
<pb facs="tcp:7694:22"/>God nothing worth? So then, it is not without cauſe that Dauid heere matcheth riches with the worde of God, and this auarice wherwith we are led and inflamed, againſt the deſire that hee had too followe God, and too walke after his word. As if he ſhould haue ſayd, Alas Lord, it is true that I am giuen to the vanities of this world aſwel as others are: But yet haue I chiefely deſired thy word, &amp; haue euen ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with my ſelf to ſubdue al the euil affections of my fleſh. Here we ſee what doctrin we haue to gather vnto our ſelues out of this place: to wit, that if we wil be the good ſcholers of God, and take delight in the way of his teſtimonyes, we muſt firſt ſubdue the luſtes of our fleſhe, &amp; not learne to be giuen to worldly things, neither yet to bee nouſled in that which we imagine to be the higheſt pointe of our felicity: but that we might vnderſtand to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne riches, &amp; al other things whatſoeuer, which might withdrawe vs from our God and our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.</note> to make no more accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it then of doung and dyrt, as S. Paule ſaith. And yet it is moſt ſure that Dauid contemneth not the riches which he had. For beeing a mightie rich king, as we know, yet he caſt not his Golde &amp; ſiluer into the botto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſea, but vſed of the abundance &amp; ſtore which God had giuen him yea wee ſee what an excellent and beautiful houſe he had, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hiſtory telleth vs. But yet he followed the rule which the Scripture ſetteth downe vnto vs: which is, that hee ſo vſed the goods of this world, as though he neuer had them. We muſt therfore paſſe through this world,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31.</note> without ſtaying our ſelues altogether in it, as S. Paul exhorteth: that if God giue vs abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of riches, we might know how to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with out hauing our harts impriſoned in them: &amp; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to be pore in ſpirit: to wit, to be redy to forſake all whatſoeuer, as often as god would haue vs to be rid of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to haue alwaies one foote redy lifted vp to go vnto him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer it ſhalbe his wil &amp; pleaſure to take vs out of this world. But it is not without cauſe that Dauid hath ſpoken heere of the abundaunce of riches. For wee ſee it maketh men couetous, which is the ſpringhead of all miſchiefe, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7694:22"/>Saint Paule ſaith.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Foraſmuch then as we are ſo much giuen to the goods of this worlde, and that we holde our ſelues accurſed if we haue not wherwithall, and them to bee ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed which are wel furniſhed with them: let vs keepe well the leſſon which is heere taught vs: to wit, that all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier muſt be in the way of the teſtimonyes of God, as in all manner of riches: to wit, that all our delight and contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be wholly in them. Now in the end Dauid goeth on and ſayth, <hi>I will meditate in thy Commaundementes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thy wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>My delight ſhalbe in thy ſtatutes: &amp; I wil not forget thy words.</q>
            <p>This is the concluſion, to confirme the matter which we haue already ſpoken off. For Dauid heere ſpeaketh of no newe matter, but proteſteth as he hath begun: That his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſhalbe alwayes in the commandements of God, &amp; in the doctrine conteined in the holy Scripture, and that hee wil beſtowe his whole ſtudy therin, &amp; ſo continue the ſame and neuer forget the deſires which he hath to profite in the obedience of God. If Dauid nowe hath thus ſaide, let vs vnderſtand that it is not inough for vs to be wel affected to ſerue God, and that for the performing thereof that wee haue already ſufficiently traueled: but we muſt alſo be pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forwarde, that we might alwayes goe on. For euen the very faithful, neuer runne with ſo feruent and hote a deſire, but that they continually draw one leg after them, &amp; neuer come vnto God but in halting wiſe. What is there then for vs to doe? Forſooth wee muſt proteſt with Dauid, neuer to forget that which God hath once declared vnto vs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo neuer to ceaſe to pricke our ſelues on, to the ende there might be greater vehemencie in vs to goe vnto him, with a more ſeruent deſire and boulder courage. So that at the laſt we may growe to this perfection, whereunto God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth &amp; allureth vs: that is, that beeing vncaſed from out of our fleſh and nature, hee might fully conioyne vs vnto his righteouſneſſe, that thereby his glory may ſhine in vs.</p>
            <p>And according to this holy doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the face of our good god, acknowledging our
<pb facs="tcp:7694:23"/>innumerable ſinnes, by which we continually prouoke his heauy wrath, and indignation againſt vs. Beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him to make vs to feele our ſinnes and iniquities, more then euer to fore we haue done, to the end we might ſeke for ſuch remedies as he hath ordained for vs in exerciſing our ſelues about the reading of his holy word, and the dayly Preaching thereof which hath graunted vnto vs. And furthermore not to forget to ſtir vs vp to call vpon him, to the end that by his holy ſpirite he might to put his helping hande euen in our heartes, and not too ſuffer the doctrine which we heare by the mouth of his Preachers, to become vnprofitable vnto vs, but that it may haue the full power &amp; ſtrength: ſo that we may from day to day be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed therein: and more and more learne to forſake the worlde, and all whatſouer may withdrawe vs from the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and coniunction of our Lord and Maiſter Ieſus Chriſt, who is our heade. And that hee will not onely ſhewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs this fauour and grace, but alſo vnto all people and nations of the earth, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T ſhall greatly haue profited vs, if ſo be wee haue learned what the ende of our life is. For, for that cauſe, hath God placed, and bringeth vs vpp in the worlde: and yet fewe there are which thinke vpon it. True it is, that euery man will ſay, that it is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wee ſhould doe homage too GOD for our life and beeing, becauſe wee holde all of him: and that wee ſhould glorifie him with ſo much of our goods as he hath largely beſtowed vpon vs. But what of all this? When as wee haue confeſſed that, it is but to ſhewe our ingratitude and vnthankfulneſſe: and yet no man maketh any account heereof. Loe heere, wherefore the holy Ghoſte, ſeeing vs ſo tyed to the worlde, putteth vs in minde too what ende wee liue heere. As heere Dauid maketh this requeſt to God too obtayne that benefite of his Maieſtie: <hi>That hee mght liue and keepe his woorde:</hi> As if hee ſhould haue ſayde, I deſire not O Lorde to liue for my ſelfe alone in this worlde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to receiue heere my pleaſures and commodyties: but deſire it too an other more precious and excellent end than that: to wit, that I might ſerue thee. Euen ſo then, as often as we are deſirous to liue, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member vs of this requeſt which Dauid maketh: That is, that we ſhoulde not be like vnto brute beaſtes, lyuing wee knowe not to what end: but that we ſhould alwayes ayme at this make, to honour GOD. For without this wee
<pb facs="tcp:7694:24"/>are more miſerable then all the reſt of his creatures. Euery creature will followe his owne naturall inclination: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that brute beaſtes haue an hard and irkeſome life, yet notwithſtanding they are not in their kinde ſo tormented &amp; greeued as we are. We know &amp; feele by experience, that our euil deſires and luſts, are like hot burning furnaces, ſo that we neede no body to perſecute and vexe vs, for ther is none of vs all, but can tel wel inough how to greeue &amp; vex our ſelues one with ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, another with couetouſnes, &amp; ſome with fornication &amp; adultery. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our life ſhould be very accurſed if we looked no farther. But we muſt alwayes aime at this marke, to ſerue God, &amp; to keepe his word. For when as all our affection and loue ſhal reſte in it, then ſhall our life be bleſſed. But contrariwiſe, when we are ſo brutiſh as to deſire nothing elſe but to liue heere a long time, &amp; to haue none other care but of our body, and this temporall life: the longer we liue heere in the world, the more do we heape vppon vs the malediction and curſe of God. Let vs then keepe in minde this prayer which Dauid heere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: to wit, that he beſeecheth God to beſtowe that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite vpon him, that he might keepe his commandement all the dayes of his life. As if he ſhould haue ſaid. Alas my God, I ſee vs to bee ſo peruerſe and frowarde, as that none of vs all thinketh to what ende we liue. And we are ſo giuen to all ſinne and wickedneſſe, that wee doo nothing elſe but more and more prouoke thy heauy wrath and indignation againſt vs. Suffer me not O Lorde to be one of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but graunt vnto me thy grace, that my life may bee ruled and gouerned as it ought to bee: that is, That I may employ my ſelfe wholy to ſerue and honour thee. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth by and by after.</p>
            <q>Open mine eyes, that I may ſee the woondrous things of thy lawe.</q>
            <p>Heere he declareth that it was not without cauſe, that he made this requeſt vnto God: For if it were in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to follow the word of God, and keepe it, it were meere hypocryſie and feyned holineſſe to make any ſuch prayer.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7694:24"/>For we craue at Gods hand that which we haue not: and in our Prayers we muſt alwayes confeſſe our pouertie and want. Were it not a mockery thinke you, too craue of God the thing which I haue already? I ſhall beſeech him to giue it me, and I haue it already in my poſſeſſion?</p>
            <p>It is moſte true, that wee muſt craue that at Gods hande which already wee haue. And why ſo? Becauſe wee are certaine that wee cannot inioy it, nor yet vſe the ſame without his grace and fauour: And that the vſe thereof ſhall neuer profite vs without he bleſſe it, euen as we deſire of him our dayly Breade. And although the table be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and the meate ſette ready on the boorde, yet we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of God to make it nouriſhment for our bodyes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as I haue before ſayde; it ſhall profite vs no whit at all, without God bleſſe it through his grace and liberalitie. It is very ſo that we doe craue it, by reaſon of our continuall confeſſing of our want and neede.</p>
            <p>So then, it cannot poſſibly bee, that this was in Dauid his owne hand and power, to keep the woorde of God. And he ſheweth it to be ſo in this which followeth, <hi>O Lorde open thou mine eyes.</hi> As if hee ſhould haue ſaide, Alas deere father, it is ſo farre off that I am able to keepe thy worde, as that I ſhould not be able to vnderſtand any whit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if thou guideſt mee not thereto: For it is thou which muſt both beginne the ſame, &amp; alſo performe it wholy in me. This is the way and meanes for vs to vnderſtande what to doe: For many there are which knowe the thinge that is good, and yet for all that they vtterly refuſe it. Nowe Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid declareth, that he is not onely voyde of all power too keepe the word of God: but alſo that hee is without all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, except it be giuen him by the holy Ghoſt. Let vs note well who it is that ſpeaketh Euen Dauid a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prophet. And yet for all that wee ſee that hee declareth (yea and that boldely) him ſelfe to bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte, without GOD iuſtructeth him: Neither dooth hee heere ſpeake of any worldely iuſtruction, as wee woulde imagine of the thinges whiche wee knewe nor
<pb facs="tcp:7694:25"/>of before. Dauid confeſſeth, that all that, would ſerue him to no purpoſe at all, without God, added therunto a notabler or more excellent thing: to wit, that hee did enlighten him with his holy ſpirite.</p>
            <p>Sithens then it is ſo that Dauid, who was an excellente Prophet, did knowe, that hee could neither by reading nor preaching vnderſtand that which was requiſite vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: what ſhall become of vs, which are yet farre from that forwardneſſe that was in him? And let vs not thinke that through our owne labour and induſtrie, and by our owne ſharpneſſe of wit, to come ſo farre as to vnderſtande the ſecretes of God, but let vs knowe that wee had neede to be inlightned with the grace of his holy ſpirit, to open our eyes, for without it we are poore blinde ſoules. Nowe if this were wel vnderſtood, we ſhould neuer ſee ſuch a pride amongſt vs as is, that euery of vs is wiſe inough too go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne himſelfe. It is an eaſy matter for vs to make proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God hath giuen vs his word: and yet for all that we ſhall ſtill be blinde, and knowe nothing, vntill ſuch time as he openeth our heartes and mindes. For when nothing elſe ſhal gouerne vs but our own ſenſe and naturall reaſon, what beaſtes and Calues ſhall wee then bee? See then how we ſhall be better inſtructed in humilitie, when as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhalbe imprinted in our heartes. True it is, that this was not ſpoken in vaine, but to the end, that we ſhoulde be admoniſhed after the example of Dauid, too preſent oure ſelues before God: and in confeſsing our ſelues that we are not capable to vnderſtande any thing, without that he put to his helping hand, let vs beſeeche him too open our eyes by his holy ſpirit. And bicauſe it ſhould not ſeeme ſtraunge, that Dauid deſired to haue his eyes open, he declareth, that the wiſdom conteined in the lawe of God, is too high for our capacities, yea although we think oure ſelues to haue neuer ſo ſharpe and fine wittes. And therefore hee ſayeth, <hi>O Lorde open myne eyes: that I may ſee the woonderous thinges of thy Lawe.</hi> Wherefore vſeth hee this woorde woonderous. It is, as if he would haue ſaue ſaide: Although
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7694:25"/>the world taketh the lawe of God to be but a light thing, and ſeemeth to be giuen but as it were for ſimple ſoules, &amp; yong children: Yet for al that there ſeemeth ſuch a wiſedom to bee in it, as that it ſurmounteth all the wiſedome of the worlde, and that therein lye hidde wonderfull ſecrets.</p>
            <p>Aſmuch is ſaide of the Goſpell, and that not without great cauſe. And in very deede, that which at this daye is moſt plainely declared in the Goſpell, was before contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the lawe: onely theſe were darker ſhadowes, then they are, which were ſince the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And yet notwithſtanding, there is no chaung or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in this wiſedome, as God alſo is not mutable.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</note> It is not then without cauſe that all the holy ſcripture is called wiſedome, and that the Angels of heauen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues do wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereat. If then the Angels be aſtoyned at the ſecrets conteined in the holy ſcripture, I beſeeche you tell mee, what reuerence deſerueth it to haue among vs mortall men? For we are but poore wormes vpon earth, creeping here belowe. If there be compariſon made betwixt vs and the Angels, what ſhall it be? See howe the Angels are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully rauiſhed to ſee the wiſedome of the word of God, and yet we make no accompt of it, but eſteeme of it as a baſe and childiſh thing. The more therefore ought wee throughly to marke this ſaying of Dauid, that the doctrine of the lawe is not as wee take it to bee: to wit, a thing of ſmall valure, or a common and ordinarie doctrine, but a wonderfull wiſedome, wherein are ſuch ſecrets as ought to rauiſh vs with admiration, bicauſe they farre ſurpaſſe our wit and reaſon. But what is the cauſe that we ſo lightly eſteeme of the lawe of God? that is to ſay, his whole word? Herein the common prouerbe is verified when we ſaye, A foole regardeth nothing. Which prouerbe we declare to be rightly verified in vs: For many of vs make no eſtimation of the holy ſcripture, &amp; it ſeemeth to vs, that, that which we reade there, is too to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon: and this is the reaſon, bicauſe we know not what it is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e yet the great and abundant treaſure hidde therein. But ſuch as haue once knowen what
<pb facs="tcp:7694:26"/>the Maieſtie of God is, which hee ſheweth and declareth him ſelfe to be there, and do ſee whether it is, that God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and allureth them, and do alſo vnderſtand and knowe the large and ſweete promiſes offered vnto them therein, ſuch I ſay, will ſay with Dauid, O Lorde, thy law is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And ſo conſequently will deſire that their eyes might be lightened, confeſsing them ſelues to be blind, vntill ſuch time as God hath ayded them with his holy ſpirite. Now it followeth,</p>
            <q>I am a ſtranger vpon earth: hyde not thy commandementes from me.</q>
            <p>When Dauid did put to this verſe, he ment to confirme the matter which before he touched, that is to ſay, that he deſired not ſimply to liue, as if his life had beene deare and precious vnto him, without any other reſpect: but he had a further meaning. For he ſaith by a by after, I am a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the world: therefore hyde not thy commandements from me: They which make their continuall neſt here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne fanſie, and thinke to make their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in this world, theſe men I ſay, haue nothing to do with the commandementes of God for their ſaluation. For they are ſafe enough if they may eate and drinke to be glutted, that they may take their pleaſures and delightes, that they may be honoured, that they may be in eſtimation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. loe here is all that they deſire or wyſh to haue. Yea for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth: For they looke no further, but to this corruptible and tranſitorie life. Theſe men I ſaye are not greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ne yet haue any care of the commaundementes of God, but when as they ſhalbe taken from them, all ſhall be one to them. When as the couetous man, the whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the dronkarde, the ambitious perſon, ſhall heare no preaching of the word at all: neither any talke of God, ne yet of Chriſtianitie, nor of life euerlaſting. He in the meane time ceaſeth not to purſue his owne waye. Yea, and it is to them a lothſome and vnpleaſant kinde of ſpeach to heare God ſpoken of, but had rather haue no mention in the whole worlde made of him. And therefore it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe why Dauid requireth, not to haue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7694:26"/>of God taken from him, &amp; this is his reaſon: to wit, bicauſe he is a ſtranger on the earth. As if he ſhould haue ſayd, O Lord, if I had none other conſideration but of this preſent life, I ſhould be euen accurſed, and it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my mother had beene deliuered of me as of a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that I had beene an hundred times plunged in hell. And why ſo? For we are here in this world but as pilgrims and wayfaring men: and we paſſe to a more excellent life: as to that alſo wherein we repoſe our whole truſt. Seeing then, O Lord, that I am a ſtranger in the world, let not thy commandementes be taken away from me. Nowe in this part is conteined a very profitable doctrine, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for vs, for we knowe how cold wee are, where in deede we ought to haue an ardent deſire to be taught the worde of God, and to be more and more confirmed therein. And I beſeeche you how careleſſe are we? But what is the cauſe hereof? No doubt of it, we muſt alwayes euen ſearche and looke into the depth and bottom of this corruption and miſchiefe: for when we ſee any vice in our ſelues, we ought to enquire from whence the cauſe proceedeth, to the ende we might finde remedy for the ſame. Now the reaſon is, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are blynde, and do ſuppoſe our abode ſhould bee here ſtill vpon earth, and euery man imagineth him ſelfe to haue here euerlaſting life. Wherefore when we are thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the world, &amp; thinke our ſelues to haue here an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting enheritance, loe this is the cauſe of our thus conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of God and his word, or rather that we care no whit at all for the ſeeking out of the doctrine of our ſaluation. What muſt we then do? Forſooth wee muſt looke a great deale further then to the world, if we will come vnto God, and be exerciſed in this ſtudy wherof me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is here made, and to ſay with Dauid, O Lord, bicauſe we are ſtrangers in this world, to wit, that we are to paſſe here only, &amp; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſhorter then our life is here, let not thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements be taken away from vs. On thother ſide, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid his meaning here, is to ſignifie vnto vs, that he was but as a poore pilgrime and wandring man, without he were conducted and guided by the worde of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:27"/>
            <p>And this is a very fit ſimilitude for the purpoſe. We know that a man in a ſtraung countrey, will thinke him ſelf to be a ſtraung and forlorne man, ſo that if he hath not a conduct and guide, he knoweth not what ſhall become of him. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo fareth it with vs, if we be not directed and conducted by the hand and power of God. And why ſo? Bicauſe we are as ſtrangers here in this world. It is very true, that wee are but too too much tied vnto our affections and wil, and yet out alas, our ſenſe and wittes are ſo confounded, that wee know not what way to take or holde, except we be ſhewed it. Loe here the meaning of the ſimilitude which Dauid here vſeth, in ſaying that he is a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in the world: which is, that he complaineth that he is a ſtrang and forlorne ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therefore beſeecheth God to guide him by his worde. Now it followeth.</p>
            <q>My hart breaketh out, for the deſire, vntoo thy iudgementes alwaies.</q>
            <p>When hee ſayeth, that his ſoule breaketh out, it is too proteſt, that hee deſired not that thing of God which wee haue hearde, either for faſhions ſake, or countenance, as many doo, which beſeeche God very often too inlighten, confirme, and guide them, in the trueth of his woorde: but in the meane tyme, they neuer ſeeke after it as they ſhould do. Now, this is but after a ſorte, and God wil not be thus mocked. For in thus doing, we doe nothing els but profane his holy name, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we make ſuch requeſtes, as proceede not from a true affection and deſire. Loe here, wherefore Dauid ſaieth, that his ſoule brake out: For this worde em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth as much as if his ſoule had vtterly fainted. My ſoule then fainteth for the deſire which it had to thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Wherfore here are three things to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered off.</p>
            <p>The one is, that if we will obtaine at Gods handes to be conducted by him, and to haue his worde to be our waye and direction, we ſhould not make ſuch an hypocritical nor cold prayer vnto him, with mocking of him thereby: But with ſuch a true deſire as carieth vs euen out of our ſelues, and to make no ſuch accompt of this preſent life, but to be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7694:27"/>well aduiſed, to ſhoote at an higher matter. And thus much as touching the firſt point, which here we haue to note.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that this deſire, ought not to be onely as a wauering deſire, but an ardent and an hoat deſire. For he ſaith, That his ſoule hath fainted. And why ſo? Let vs here a little conſider, what our appetites and luſtes are, when wee turne our ſelues away from God, and giue our ſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to worldly things. They are ſo exceſsiue and inordinate, that it is euen pitifull, being without end and meaſure. But if we haue a leane deſire, &amp; ſuch a one as I know not what, to walke according to the will of God: this deſire woulde be as ſoone alayed, as a droppe of wine put into an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth times ſo much water. I beſeeche you what ſhall that be? ſhall it taſte any more as wine? Euen ſo forcible ſhould the good affection of a faithfull man be. If this affection be not feruent, and very vehement, it ſhalbe ſoone choked by the corruptions of our carnall paſsions &amp; affections which (as I haue before ſaid) haue neither meaſure, modeſtie, nor temperance. See then for the ſecond point what we haue here to note in this behalf, to wit, that it is not enough that we haue a meane deſire to ſerue God, for that woulde bee very ſoone quenched in vs, and be made nothing woorth. But we muſt be ſo attentiue thereto, as that we may able to ſay that our ſoule fainteth, and languiſheth, that our power and ſtrength droppeth and melteth away as it were vntill ſuch time as God relieueth vs, in graunting that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs which we require of him.</p>
            <p>The third point which we haue here to note, is, the firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and conſtancie in this our deſire. And ſee here why Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid is not contented with this ſaying, that his ſoule is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out: but he ſaieth, <hi>Alwayes,</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide, this was not a blaſte of wynde, but a rooted affection in his heart, and that he perſeuered therein. Nowe theſe three things are moſt neceſſarie: For we ſee in the firſt place that we are as it were by nature enclined to vanitie, bicauſe that being ſo addicted vnto the world, we thinke no whit at all of heauen. We ought therefore to bee ſo much the more
<pb facs="tcp:7694:28"/>very attentiue to this doctrine, &amp; to haue a burning deſire to follow the word of God: and beſides this our affection ought to be ſo vehement, as that it might be able to haue the dominion ouer all our affections, which hinder vs to cleaue vnto our God, and eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be marueilouſly rauiſhed therewith. Now it had neede to be mightely ſtrengthened with the power of the ſpirite of God: For our luſtes beeing too too mad and furious, if God ſtretched not foorth his arme vnto it, what ſhould become thereof? And put the caſe that we had a good deſire, ſurely it woulde very ſoone vaniſh away in vs. We muſt be wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull feruent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and afterward, when wee hall haue ſuch a good and ſtedfaſt affection, we muſt be wonderfully in loue with the word of God, not for a day, nor yet for a ſhort time, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo long as we liue. It followeth ſoone after.</p>
            <q>Thou haſt deſtroyed the proud: curſed are they, that do erre from all thy commaundementes.</q>
            <p>Dauid addeth hereto an other reaſon, whereby hee is more enflamed to praye vnto God, and to addreſſe him ſelfe vnto him, to be taught in his word: to wit, when hee ſeeth that he hath ſo rebuked the proude: For the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and puniſhementes which God layeth vppon the faithles and rebellious, ſhoulde bee a good inſtruction for vs: As it is ſaid: That God hath executed iudgement, and that the inhabitantes of the land ſhould learne his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes. It is not without cauſe that the Prophet Eſay alſo hath ſo ſaid: for he ſignifieth vnto vs, that God hath by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and ſundrie meanes drawen vs vnto him, and that chiefly when he teacheth vs to feare his maieſtie. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, out alas, we ſhall become like vnto brute beaſtes, if God laye the bridle in our neckes, what licence we will giue vnto our ſelues, experience very well teacheth vs. Now God ſeeing that we are ſo eaſily brought to runne at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſendeth vs examples, bicauſe he woulde bring vs to walke in feare and carefully.</p>
            <p>And for our part, when wee ſee God to chaſtiſe the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diſobedient, we ſhould by them take example and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7694:28"/>inſtruction. Loe here (in ſumme) what Dauid ſaieth. Thou O Lorde, haſt chaſtiſed the diſobedient: as if hee ſhoulde haue ſaide, True it is, O Lord, that I haue deſired, euen with a vehement affection, and true conſtancie, to cleaue vnto thee, and to thy holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes: But yet had I neede to be more throughly inſtructed, that I might beware of the puniſhementes which I haue ſeene with mine eyes. When I haue ſeene that thou chaſtiſedſt the proude, I haue beene by and by humbled thereby: ſo much diſcipline haue I receiued by it, ſee then nowe why I do beſeeche thee, that I might be more carefully and diligently inſtructed in thy law. If now it was behooueful for Dauid (who was already ſo well inſtructed in the law) to be thus aided for the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him ſelfe to God, to wit, that hee ſeeth the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers puniſhed, and God to laye his hand vpon them: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche you tell me, had not we neede of ſuch inſtruction, &amp; alſo of a great deale more? And ſo, as oftentimes as we ſhal plainely ſee, God to ſend his chaſtiſements into the world, to puniſhe ſinne, we ought greatly to conſider thereof, and to vnderſtande that it commeth not by aduenture or chaunce (as we commonly ſaye.</p>
            <p>And when GOD ſo ſtriketh the proude and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, let vs conſider that he meaneth not to puniſh their perſons, and bodies onely, but to teache vs, to haue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regarde to our ſelues: that wee might bee humbled, to the ende the like fall not vppon vs. For God doeth vs great pleaſure, when hee puniſheth others, thereby to teache vs to take heede: as alſo it is great wiſedome for a man to beware by the harme of an other according to the olde prouer be. And ſo alſo meaneth God. Let vs then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the fauour and grace which he ſheweth vnto vs, when as he ſetteth foorth his iudgementes before vs, it is to aduertiſe vs of our faultes, to the end we ſhould the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter walke in his feare, to obey him: yea, and that he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth others for our amendement, as I haue already ſayd. And eſpecially he addeth, <hi>Curſed are they that erre from thy commaundementes,</hi> or that goe wrong.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:29"/>
            <p>By this hee farther declareth and expreſſeth that which wee haue already ſhewed, to witte, howe hee hath beene taught to walke according to the will of God, by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes which lighted vpon the proud and diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And here he maketh this generall concluſion, That all they which erre from the commaundemen of God are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Whereupon we are to gather firſt of all, that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular iudgementes of God ought not to ſerue vs for one deede alone: but that we ſhould apply it for a generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction all the dayes of our life. As how? When as we ſee God puniſh one perſone, O, wee muſt not ſtay our ſelues vpon ſuch an act, to ſay, that God puniſheth but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which deſerueth it: but wee muſt conclude and ſay (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying of S. Paul) There is no reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11.</note> Now when he hath puniſhed ſuch a fault, we muſt then ſay, that this fault diſpleaſeth him in as many as do committe it. As in an other place he ſheweth, Sithens that God ſo grieuouſly puniſhed the children of Iſrael for Idolatrie, we muſt conclude that he vtterly abhorreth Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. As greatly alſo abhorreth he Lechery, murmuring, &amp; diſobedient perſons, and horrible &amp; wicked couetouſnes. And all this (ſaith S. Paul) ſhould ſerue vs for an Image or paterne,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 7.8.9.10.</note> to the end, that when we ſee the like come to paſſe, we ſhould remember vs of that which is conteined within the holy ſcripture, and applie it wholy to our own vſe and profite. And thus much as touching the firſt point, which we haue here to note: to wit, that if God puniſheth a man, we muſt gather out of it a generall inſtruction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all they which go wrong from the commaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God are accurſed.</p>
            <p>Now we haue to touch the ſecond point, which is alſo notable: that is, we muſt not tarrie vntill ſuch time as God ſcourgeth vs, but beeing aduertiſed by that which hee hath ſhewed vs a farre of, wee might preuent the puniſhmentes and corrections. which might light vpon vs in the end.</p>
            <p>And this is it which wee muſt gather vnto our ſelues in generall, of that which hath beene ſpoken. That all they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7694:29"/>which erre from the commaundementes of God, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let vs alſo in the third place learne, that all the happineſſe which we imagine, when wee are farre from God, is nothing but accurſed, and that in the ende the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of our Lord Ieſus muſt be accompliſhed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hes and deſires, and that it hath obteined the chiefe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, that it is euen then vnder the greateſt and chiefeſt curſe. And why ſo? For all they which ſtray from God, are accurſed, bicauſe that hee is the fountaine of all goodnes, and without him there is nothing but all miſerie. True it is, that for a time hee ſuffereth the infidels and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to make them ſelues mery, that we might thinke them to be the happieſt people in the worlde, but what of that? It will all returne to their greater confuſion. It followeth ſoone after,</p>
            <q>Remooue from me ſhame and contempte: for I haue kept thy teſtimonies.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid commenceth a newe ſuice vnto God, to wit, that he would hold him in his innocencie and puritie. And it is not without cauſe that he ſo doeth, for we ſee that they which ſerue God with their whole heart, are contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and deſpiſed, yea, they are moſt ſhamefully ſlaundered. For we ſee euen at this daye, that he which walketh ſimply, he ſhall by and by be called an hypocrite. All they which would ſerue God, are thus cried out vpon, O theſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites! O theſe mortified! See here how the puritie &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the faith full is deſpiſed &amp; naught ſet by. For the deuil poſſeſſeth the contemners of God in ſuch ſort, as that they vomit out their blaſphemies , not onely againſt thoſe whome they purpoſe to oppoſe them ſelues, but euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But this miſchiefe and corruption is not of a dayes hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching:
<pb facs="tcp:7694:30"/>and therefore wee are throughly to conſider the ſaying which Dauid here ſetteth downe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O turne from me rebuke,</hi> to wit, ſuffer mee not O Lorde, to be lightly eſteemed of men, bicauſe I haue kept thy te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies. Wee ſee then that the ſumme of this verſe is this: That Dauid deſireth GOD to vpholde and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine his puritie. Now the cauſe is incontinently added,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For princes alſo did ſit,</hi> vnder the ſhadowe of Iuſtice, <hi>and ſpeake againſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe this was a great temptation to Dauid, that hee was not onely mocked and ſcorned at the Tauernes and Innes, beeing there blaſoned by diſſolute Ieſters and Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and talked of in the ſtreetes and market places, but euen in the place of Iuſtice (which ought to bee holy) it could not therefore bee choſen but that they alſo woulde vtterly defame and ſlaunder him, and condemne him to be as it were a moſt wicked and curſed man. When Dauid then did ſee, that he was thus vniuſtly intreated and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, hee maketh his complaint vnto God: and ſayeth, O Lorde the Princes and Gouernours them ſelues doe ſit and ſpeake euill againſt me: <hi>And yet for all that I haue kept thy Teſtimonies.</hi> Herein ſumme we are to gather out of this place, that if it ſo fall out, when as wee haue walked vprightly and in a good conscience, to bee falſely ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, to bee accuſed of this and that, whereof we neuer once thought: yet ought we to beare all thinges patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for let vs be ſure of that, that we are not better then Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, although we would make neuer ſo great proteſtation of our integritie and puritie.</p>
            <p>Dauid walked both before God and men ſo faithfully as none of vs all is able to doe, and yet wee ſee that he was ſubiect to theſe ſlaunderous reportes. Let vs then be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, when the like ſhall happen to vs. But let vs alſo follow his example in that hee ſayeth, that is, that wee ſhoulde not be diſcouraged: ſeeing our ſelues to be ſo euill and vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompenſed at mens handes, that we forbeare not for all that to exerciſe our ſelues in the commaundementes of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7694:30"/>God. And howe ſhould we come by that patience? wee muſt come to that which he there ſpeaketh off, to wit, that wee take all our whole delight and pleaſure in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God. It is the thing which hee often beateth vpon before by me touched, and therefore it ſhall not be needefull to ſtaye vpon it any longer.</p>
            <p>Let vs onely vnderſtand this, when Dauid ſayeth, that all his pleaſure was in the commaundementes of GOD, that we (after his example) muſt doe the like. Hee added,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are my Councellers.</hi> Loe here a ſentence worthy to be wayed of vs, when Dauid calleth the commaundements of God his counſaylers: for in the firſt place he meaneth, that he might ſcorne at all the wiſedome of the moſt able and moſt expert men in the worlde, howe goodly and gay ſhewes ſoeuer their counſailes ſeeme to be to thoſe, which ſo exceedingly commend them, and are alſo commended of all in that he was conducted by the word of God, &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned therby. Lo what he meaneth here by the firſt point.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That when he ſhalbe ſo gouerned by the word of God, he might not onely ſaye that hee was truely wyſe, but that it was ſo much, as if he had all the wiſedome of all the men in the worlde, yea and a great deale more, put euen in one man. When any one man miſtruſteth his owne witte, hee will aſke councell, and arme him ſelfe the better, and when he ſhall haue vſed ſuch counſell, as euery one ſhall ſoundly giue him, hee will holde him ſelfe a great deale the better reſolued.</p>
            <p>Dauid then declareth vnto vs, that if wee will not bee without good counſell and aduiſe, we muſt follow the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and ordinances of God. But what? fewe men at this day are able in truth thus to ſaye. Euery man will ſaye the beſt for him ſelfe he can, and yet it ſhalbe all but a mere mockerie. Howe many of vs are there which will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be gouerned as hee was, by this counſell? Wee ſhall hardly finde one amonges an hundreth. Howe do we iuſtly promiſe our ſelues rightly to knowe that GOD hath ſpoken vnto vs?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:31"/>
            <p>And let it be that we are in the right way, what aſſurance haue we of it? It cannot be choſen but that the leaſt let in the world will trouble vs: Our ſpirite alwayes greatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be contrary to God, we haue greater regarde to the vayne opinions and fantaſies of men, then to the heauenly doctrine, ſo that we lende out eares to whatſoeuer men ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and are ſo caried with euery wynde, that we knowe not what it is to holde our ſelues to the counſell; of God.</p>
            <p>And ſo let vs bee aduiſed to make out profit of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, beſeching the Lord to graunt vs that his grace, that we may be gouerned by him, and that with ſuch humilitie and reuerence, as that whatſoeuer is ſet before vs in this world, we may alwayes go on our wayes, in true and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible conſtancie. And according to this holy doctrine, let vs proſtrate out ſelues before the face of our good God, in acknowledging our faultes: beſeching him that it woulde pleaſe him to gouerne vs in ſuch ſorte, as that we looke not downe here on the earth, ne yet ſtoope downe to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things of this world, but that we might continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſpire vnto this heauenly life, where unto hee daily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs by his worde: And for performance thereof to ſuffer vs to be truely vnited to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, yea, and that with an inſeparable bond, as wee may alwayes followe the waye which he hath ſhewed vnto vs, vntill ſuch time as wee be come to that immortall glorie, whereunto he hath gone before vs, to gather vs all vp vnto him, and to make vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that bleſſedneſſe, which hee hath gotten and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by his death and paſsion, and where of he will make vs enheritours with him in the kingdome of heauen. That he will not onely graunt vs this grace and fauour, but alſo vnto all people and nations of the earth, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Auid ſheweth vnto vs in theſe eight verſes what the ioye and contentation of the children of God ought to bee. And this is a doctrine for vs, moſt profitable. For there is not that man which longeth not too haue the thing that may content and delight him: but there is none of vs which holdeth the true meane. So much the more therefore ought we rightly to recorde
<pb facs="tcp:7694:32"/>the leſſon heere conteined: to wit, that all our reioyring is accurſed, and will come to an euill end if wee looke not to God and to his worde. Loe wherefore here he ſayeth,</p>
            <q>My ſoule cleaueth vnto the duſt: quicken me according to thy word.</q>
            <p>Dauid confeſſeth here that hee was driuen to an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. For behold what hee meaneth by this ſaying, That his ſoule (or life) cleaueth vnto the duſt: As if hee ſhoulde haue ſaid, O Lord, there is nothing that I more looked for then my graue, I am like to a poore caſtaway and forlorne creature. Nowe whether or to whome ſhould he haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe? Euen vnto God, hee deſireth to be reſtored. And how may that be? according to the promiſſe which he hath receiued. We ſee then whether, and to whom we muſt haue recourſe in all our neceſsities, And thus much for the firſt point. The Second is, when that wee ſhall haue had our refuge to God, we might finde in him wherewith fully to reioyce vs. Thus much then for the ſecond. The third is, That if we will obteine tobe reſtored at Gods handes, wee being as it were dead and confounded, ſhould looke vnto his promiſes: For behold he will giue vs encouragement to come vnto him. We haue here then a good admonition and very profitable: that is, That as often as we ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed with all the miſerie that can be, we ſhould yet looke vnto God, bicauſe that then hee will ſeeke after vs more then euer he did before, willing vs to come vnto him. But here we are to note, that there is not any ſo great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie which ought to let and ſtay vs from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ſtraight on vnto him: For Dauid confeſſeth that he was become as a dead man. When then wee ſhalbe euen as it were at the laſt caſt, as we ſay, that we can no more, that we ſhould bee as a man would ſaye, oppreſſed and ouercome with ſorowe and griefe, yea and that the graue euen gapeth to ſwallowe vs vp, let vs not for all that ceaſſe to beſeeche God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore vs. For it belongeth properly vnto him, when he hath appealed and brought vs to deathes dore, to reſtore and quicken vs againe.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:7694:32"/>
            <p>But we are to vnderſtande that we muſt not come vnto him after an hypocritical maner: we muſt not require him too reſtore vs, and yet haue our mindes wandering here and there, neither yet muſt we ſeeke for that thing in the worlde, which wee make countenance to ſeeke for at his handes: We muſt not make vs two wayes to the woode as we ſaye, but our whole delight and contentation muſt bee in God and in his grace, that it ſuffiſeth vs to haue him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to feele his mercie and compaſsion towardes vs: and when wee haue gotten that, to bee contented onely therewith. But bicauſe we can not come vnto God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he him ſelfe draweth vs, when as wee deſire him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore vs, and to ſtretche out his hande vnto vs, wee muſt adde thereto this ſaying here expreſſed, to wit, that he will quicken vs according to his word. Now by this, as I haue already ſayde, wee are taught that in the middeſt of death we finde ſaluation and health, bicauſe the promiſes of God neuer fayle vs. It followeth in the ſecond verſe,</p>
            <q>I haue declared my wayes, and thou heardeſt mee: teache me thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid alledgeth another reaſon that GOD hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, to wit, that this is not the firſt time that he had heard him, neither yet that God is mercifull and liberall, to graunt vnto his faithfull, their petitions and requeſtes. But wee in very deede muſt, in continuing the matter which wee are here in hande to open, be throughly aſſured and reſolued, that it is not in vayne, when as we make our prayers vnto God, neither yet that wee loſe our labours, but that our prayers ſhall profite vs. We muſt therefore be fully reſolued herein. And howe muſt that bee? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, Dauid euen very now alledged vnto God, his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes aſſuring him ſelfe that hee receiued them through his meere mercy and goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>And this is no foolehardineſſe. Euen ſo then, let vs in no caſe feare to come vnto God boldly and cherefully vpon this condition, yea ſo long as wee builde vpon his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb facs="tcp:7694:33"/>We muſt not come vnto him according to our owne fantaſies: neither muſt we allege and ſaye, my God, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent my ſelfe here before thy maieſtie, bicauſe I thinke or ſuppoſe that thou oughteſt to heare me: this were too too fonde and lewde arrogancie: but to ſaye, Alas my good God, it is very true that I am not worthy to come neare vnto thy preſence: and although it ſhall ſeeme to me that I might approche to thee, yet muſt I pull back that foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: Neuertheleſſe, ſince thou biddeſt me to come vnto thee, and haſt commaunded me to call vpon thee, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed alſo for to heare mee: Loe here my God the cauſe which maketh mee ſo bolde, not to doubt to come vnto thee, bicauſe I beleeue thy worde. And now O Lorde, I ſtand in no doubt that thou wilt not receiue mee, when as I thus buylde vpon thy promiſſe.</p>
            <p>After Dauid hath vſed this kinde of ſpeech, to ſtirre him ſelfe vp to praye vnto God, and alſo to obtaine his requeſt, he addeth, <hi>O Lorde, I haue acknowledged my wayes, and thou heardeſt mee.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide, Ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides thy promiſe, my God, there is another reaſon which enboldeneth and encourageth me to come vnto thee: to wit, the experience which thou haſt ſhewed vnto me of thy great goodnes. I neuer required any thing of thee in myne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie, but thou diddeſt heare me: to witte, but that thou ſatiffiedſt my requeſt, but that I haue felt howe thou haſt relieued thy ſeruauntes, and haſt alwayes beene ready to ſuccoure them in their diſtreſſe: Yea, O Lorde, and that thou haſt not tarried nor wayted vntill they came vnto thee, but haſt euen offered thy ſelfe firſt vnto them.</p>
            <p>Seeing then it is ſo that thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelfe to be ſo good and liberall, O, I nowe doubt not but that thou wilt continue the ſame thy goodneſſe: Wherefore I beſeeche thee teache mee thy ſtatutes. See here a text worthy the marking: For, as I haue before ſayde, wee muſt not come vnto God doubting and wauering: but with full reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hee will heare vs.</p>
            <p>And howe is that? O, we haue a moſt ſure and infallible
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7694:33"/>teſtimonie: too wit, he hath promiſed too bee neare vnto al thoſe which ſhal craue and begge of him in trueth: we may then ſay, wee beſeeche thee, O Lord, to haue regarde vnto vs according too thy woorde. It is very true, that wee are vnwoorthy that thou ſhouldeſt bee careful ouer vs: But ſo it is, that hauing thy woorde and promiſe, wee may boldly come vnto thee: and beſides, let vs adde there too the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which God hath already ſhewed vntoo vs: that hee neuer forgetteth his, but preſerueth and keepeſh them, and alwaies watcheth ouer them. And why ſo? That wee ought to be much more heedful then wee are of al the benefits of God, too the ende wee might come too this conſideration of the reaſon which Dauid heere bringeth in: too wit, that wee might ſay vntoo God, that hee hath hearde vs. Nowe there are very fewe of vs that can doo this. And why ſo? Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that when we are in any diſtreſſe, wee neuer thinke to cal vpon God, yea although the griefe or diſeaſe preſſe and grieue vs neuer ſo much. And yet if wee doo then cal vpon him, it is ſo, that aſſoone as we haue eſcaped the danger, we wil not acknowledge it too bee God that hath had pytie and compaſsion vppon vs, but is quyte out of memory and troden cleane vnder foote. By cauſe then we remember not the benefites of God, Loe what is the cauſe why we cannot ſay, when wee come afreſh to pray, O Lord, thou haſt heard mee. For (as I haue before ſaide) our vnthankfulneſſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth vs that we cannot haue any ſuch experience &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe too pray vntoo God inceſſauntly. And ſee alſo what is the cauſe of our ſo colde and faynt prayers: for if wee were ready too cal to minde the graces of God: O, we ſhould be ſure and certaine to bee alwaies fenced, when as we meant to preſent our ſelues before him, to ſay, Alas my God, this is no noueltie vnto mee: neither ought I, Lorde, to thinke it ſtraunge too preſent my ſelfe before thee, for thou haſt graunted mee free acceſſe and libertie: this is not the firſt tyme that thou haſt doone mee good, no, I haue felte thy fauour by experience euen from my youth: and when as I ſhal ſpeak e of the number of tymes which thou haſt hearde
<pb facs="tcp:7694:34"/>me, I ſhall finde them infinite: I may very well then repoſe and put all my truſt in thee, hoping that thou wilt continue thy goodneſſe towardes me, as thou art alwayes ready ſo to doe. Nowe becauſe we are ſo vnthankfull vnto God, as not to acknowledge his benefites as becommeth vs, and as to him apperteyneth: Loe here, why we cannot benefite our ſelues by this confeſſion in truth, to confirme our hope to come vnto him, as ſhould be good for vs.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, we are to note, that we muſt not deale with God, as with mortall men. For if any man hath doone vs a pleaſure, we may truely ſay, as we commonly do: I ſhalbe the more beholding vnto you, becauſe you haue already bound mee thereto, this ſhall come in amongſt the reſte: But yet if we ſhall haue borrowed much of any man, wee ſhall be a ſhamed that we haue troubled him ſo often. But the caſe ſtandeth not ſo betwixt God and vs. And why ſo? For God is neuer weary of well dooing as men are, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he neuer diminiſheth his ſubſtaunce when hee dooth vs any good. If any man beſtoweth his goodes liberally vpon vs, hee hath ſo much the leſſe: if he giue his woorde for vs: hee will ſay, this is all that I can doe for you. But God ſo aboundeth in riches, that it is like too a Spring which can neuer be drawne dry: &amp; the more that is drawn out of it, the greater abundance is to be ſeene.</p>
            <p>So then, wee muſt not be affrayde too come vnto God, when as he ſhall haue beſtowed vpon vs ſtore of wealth, &amp; that we ſhall be ſo much bounde vnto him, as is poſſible to be thought, but the ſame ought to make vs the boulder, as Dauid heere declareth vnto vs. And of this are many like ſayings in the Scripture. <hi>O Lorde</hi> (ſayth Iacob) <hi>I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer woorthy of the benefites which thou haſte beſtowed vſon me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 32 10.</note> 
               <hi>but yet thou haſte ſo bountifully dealte with thy ſeruaunte, as that I must needes call vpon thy name continually.</hi> See then, howe GOD moueth vs to come familyarly vnto him, by reaſon that he ſheweth him ſelfe ſo liberall, and hath his hands wyde open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>to the ende hee might giue vs whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee ſtand in neede off. And when as bee ſhall haue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7694:34"/>continued thus all the dayes of our life, wee ought the boldelyer to call vpon him as Dauid him ſelfe ſheweth vs heere by example. And now let vs mark his ſaying:</p>
            <q>I haue declared my wayes, and thou heardſt mee: teach mee thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>Dauid heere proteſteth that God hath giuen eare vnto his particular matters, to wit, when as he was perplexed and full of forowe, hee then called vpon God. Loe what this worde, <hi>Way,</hi> in the Hebrue meaneth, where it is ſayde, I haue acknowledged my wayes, and thou anſwearedſt me: to witte, heardſt me. Heerevpon hee deſireth that God woulde teache him his Statutes: to witte, that hee woulde ſhewe him the right rule to liue wel. Heere we are to note, that God yeldeth his conſent euen vnto vs, and that hee will aſſiſt vs in all our ſeuerall needes. We ſee that our Lorde Ieſus hath taught vs too aſke our dayly breade, which importeth all that concerneth this tranſitory life. Euen ſo when we haue any thing to doe or too treate off, God graunteth vnto vs this priuiledge and licence too come vrito him: yea if wee ſhould ſteppe on but one pace, or but remooue our hand, we may come vnto God, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him to direct and conduct vs.</p>
            <p>Let vs then marke this ineſtimable goodneſſe which God vſeth towards vs, when hee ſeeth well that wee haue ſhewed vnto him all our wayes: to witte, all our deſires and ſmalleſt matters. If a man had his brother or deere companion, he durſt hardly ſhewe him ſelfe ſo familyarly, for feare he would be importune vpon him, as God giueth vs leaue too come vnto him. What bountie is this? Nowe when wee ſee that God maketh himſelfe ſo familyar in our ſmall affayrs ſo much the ſnore ought we to beſeech him, after the example of Dauid, that he would conduct vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his lawe: to witte, that hee will graunte vs his grace to liue in ſuch ſorte, as that wee may followe the rule which hee hath ſette downe heere vnto vs. See then, howe that by the leſſe, wee muſte come too the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as by particularityes wee muſte come to generalities.
<pb facs="tcp:7694:35"/>From the leſſe too the greater, ſay I, is this, That if God giueth vnto vs our dayly breade, let vs alſo craue of him health for our ſoules. If God will ſo humble him ſelfe, as to aduiſe vs: when we haue any thing to doe amongſt men, about the earthly affaires of this tranſitory life, let vs alſo beſeech him to doe vs this good, as to conduct: vs likewiſe according to his lawe. Loe heere how we may come from the leſſer to the greater. Wee may alſo diſcend from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities to generalities, when as we ſhall ſay, O Lorde, thou haſt hearde me in ſuch a thing, which is a ſpeciall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: now by a more forcible reaſon, I may call vpon thee for a thinge which may ſerue me all the dayes of my life, which is, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt ſet me into the way of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou wouldſt keepe me therein, and that thou neuer forſake me, vntill ſuch time as thou haſt brought mee vnto that ende and perfection, whereunto thou haſt called me.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>Make me to vnderſtand the way of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes: and I will meditate of thy woondrous woorkes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Marke heere the thirde reaſon which Dauid alledgeth to obtaine of God, that he might bee taught in his lawe. <hi>O Lorde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>make me to vnderſtande the way of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and ſo ſhall I talke of thy woondrous woorkes.</hi> As if hee ſhould haue ſayd, O Lorde, if it be thy good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure inſtruct me according to thy will, and it ſhall not ſerue for my ſelfe onely: but alſo for my neighbours: for I will indeuour my ſelfe to bring alſo others vnto thee. And thus we ought to vſe the graces and giftes of God: to wit, that they be not as it were buryed in vs, but that wee may alſo profite our neighbours: and to communicate them vnto ſuch, as they may doe good vnto, to the ende that God may be honoured, and that they all may ſerue to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaluation of the members, of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But heere we haue in this Texte too note, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for vs to inſtruct others, except we haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſciples and Scholers of God. There area greate many which will put foorth them ſelues, as if they were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7694:35"/>ſufficient and able Clearkes inoughe too teach others: And in ſo thruſting in them ſelues, they haue not once knowen what they ought to vnderſtand, either for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or yet for any others. Let vs then conſider the order which is heere obſerued: to wit, that euery of vs doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our owne ignoraunce. Dauid was a moſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prophet, and yet notwithſtanding he beſought God that he woulde make him too vnderſtande the way of his commaundementes. Yea, but had not he the Lawe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? Wherefore then deſired he that which hee had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his handes? For he knewe well inough that to read, to preach, and to heare, was not all that was needfull: For vnleſſe God open our eares, we ſhall neuer be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. And therfore it behoueth that he inlighten vs, or elſe we ſhall neuer be able to ſee the brightneſſe thereof, albeit it lye wide open before our eyes. If Dauid made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt (as we haue already heeretofore intreated) I beſeech you what ſhall we doe then? Let vs then euen ſo confeſſe our ignoraunce, and beſeech God that it would pleaſe him to teach vs. See now that we muſt needes bee firſt ſcholers: before we vſurpe the office of a Maiſter: and before wee thruſt our ſelues in, too ſpeake vnto others, that we heare God firſt ſpeake vnto vs, and that we bee grounded in his woorde, that we may proteſt as Saint Peeter telleth vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11.</note> that it is the woorde of GOD which commeth out of our mouthes. <hi>Who ſoeure ſpeaketh,</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>let him ſpeake the woord of God.</hi> For it is rid reaſon that a mortall man ſhoulde extoll him ſelfe, and preferre his owne dreames and fantaſies. And although that this ſacriledge be ouer-common in the worlde, it behoueth vs too haue greate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde therto: &amp; that we al keepe ſilence, &amp; that both great and ſmall, ignoraunt and wiſe, the ſimple and learned, giue eare to the word of God, &amp; ſuffer them ſelues to be taught by him: and after that, euery man according to thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he hath receiued, to communicate them vnto his neighbours. And when any of vs ſhall be better inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the word of God then any of our brethren, we ought
<pb facs="tcp:7694:36"/>ſo much the more to exhorte them that haue neede therof to reprehende and rebuke thoſe which make defaulte, and to inſtruct the ignoraunt and vnlearned. For our Lorde God beſtoweth not his graces liberally vpon vs, to the end we ſhould holde them faſt locked as it were in a cheſt: but that we ſhould make them common to others, to ſet forth and commend them to other according as opportunitie ſhall ſerue, and alſo according to the diſpoſitions of thoſe to whome we addict our ſelues to teach, are contented to heare vs.</p>
            <p>Moreouer when Dauid ſayth, <hi>That hee will ſpeake of the woondrous woorkes of God.</hi> Let vs marke that he dooth it not of any ambition, or vaine glory, as many doe, which could be very wel contented that we ſhould heare them, when as they ſhall doe nothing elſe but babble at randon of the worde of God. And why is that? It is becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane it, without hauing any reuerence thereto. For wee ſee that the moſte ignoraunt will be moſt bolde, according to the olde ſaying, None ſo bolde as blinde Bayard, or, A fooliſh man doubteth no perill. When ſoeuer any would goe about to teach them, O by and by the word of God ſhall be nothing with them: For ye ſhall haue them alwayes to haue anſweares ready coyned in their ſleeues. There are then which woulde be accounted great Clarkes, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhewe them ſelues not to knowe what holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Maieſtie the worde of God carryeth with it. But contrarywiſe Dauid telleth vs, that if we will inſtruct and teach our neighboures, that wee ought firſte to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the lawe of GOD to be full of woonderfull and ſtraunge ſecrets: to be ſo high a wiſdome, as that we ought not to preſume to take on hande too handle it without all modeſtie and ſobrietie. Let vs then learne, if we will be good Doctors and teachers, to proceede in all hunblenes and feare, knowing that the leaſt ſentence in the ſcripture ſurmounteth our vnderſtanding, and that wee are too too dull and blockiſh to attaine vnto ſo high wiſdome, except the Lord our God guideth and leadeth vs thereto. Lo how
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7694:36"/>that both ſcholers and maiſters &amp; as many as are hearers, and ſpeaker, ought to come with great reuerence when as they meane to handle the word of God. It followeth ſoone after: <hi>My ſoule melteth with very heauineſſe: raiſe me vp ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy woorde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere Dauid more cleerely expreſſeth that which wee haue already touched: to witte, that the abundaunt ioy of the faythfull conſiſteth wholly in this, that God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful vnto them, and knowing him to be ſuch one, they are comforted by his grace, nothing douting of his good will, And to proue it to be ſo, Dauid ſaith in the firſt place, <hi>My ſoule melieth away with very heauineſſe,</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, that all his power and vertue was cleane gone from him. For this ſimilitude heere, is alſo very well ſet downe in diuerſe places of the Scripture. We haue guſhed and burſt out like water. So then, ſee how Dauid is heere become as a forlorne man, ſo throwne downe and humbled, as that he is cleane voyde of all ſtrength, and all other things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, and therevpon beſeecheth God to comfort him. Now heere we are to note that he ſpeaketh not of the feeblenes of his body, to ſay that he was humbled by ſickneſſe, &amp; yet his ſoule to be luſty and ſtrong: but he ſayth that he is mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away with very heauineſſe, as if he ſhould haue ſaid, that he was vtterly ouerthrowne. And therevpon he deſireth to be comforted, and that by the worde of God. Heere then we ſee, that when God ſhall mortifie vs, we ſhall be as men forlorne: and that not onely all our force and ſtrength in this preſent life ſhall be of no value, but alſo our ſoules and ſpirites ſhalbe as it were humbled and caſt downe, too this ende that we might boldely call vpon God after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Dauid Let vs not feare then that God wil forſake vs, but let vs rather learne to beſeech him to comforte vs, for Dauid hath ſhewed vs the way vnto it, neither went hee ſo on of his owne proper motion, but it was the ſpirit of God which puſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hed him forward thereto. Wherefore, hauing ſo good a guyde, let vs not feare, to be fruſtrate and voyde of our petitions and demaundes, ſo long as wee followe the doctrine heerein conteyned.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:37"/>
            <p>Nowe returneth hee to the firſte Argument which we haue already touched: to wit, <hi>according to the woord of God.</hi> Wherein we ſee, that all the aſſurance and certaintie which we ought to haue in our prayers to God, is, to looke vnto that which hee hath promiſed vs. For they which truſt vnto themſelues, and think there is ſufficient in them, why God ſhould heare them: it, is moſt ſure that they ſhal neuer open their mouthes to deſire any thing of God: or if they doe, it ſhall be all but meere hypocriſie: As in Popery, where wee are not taught the promiſes of God True it is that they wil babble much, mumble ouer a number of Pater Noſters with a mixture of Aues, yea and will alſo direct their Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſter to the Puppet of S. <hi>Agatha,</hi> or ſome other Saint, as if it were too God. Nowe this is nothing elſe but beaſtly to profane the name of God. And therefore I haue ſayde that the principaleſt poynt that we ought to vſe in praying vnto God, is to lay before him his promiſes ſaying: O Lord God it is true that we rightly deſerue to be reiected of thee, but ſeeing thou inuiteſt and calleſt vs, ſhall wee goe from thee? Is it not meete that we ſhould doe thee this honour, as to giue credite vnto thy worde, and to holde it for ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and ſure? Sithens then it is ſo, that we haue thy promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we may boldely truſt vnto them, conſidering that they are true, and becauſe wee cannot but haue them graunted vnto vs, we onely reſt and ſtay our ſelues vpon them. Loe heere the meaning of Dauid in this verſe. Nowe hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on and ſayth,</p>
            <q>Take from me the way of lying: and graunt mee gratiouſly thy Lawe.</q>
            <p>Heere he acknowledgeth, that although hee were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy exercyſed in the lawe of God, and in his knowledge, and that although he were a Prophet to teach others, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, that he was yet ſubiect to a number of wicked thoughtes and imaginations which might alwayes wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leade him from the right way, except God had helde him with his mightie and ſtrong hande. And this is a poynte which we ought heere rightly to note: For wee ſee howe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7694:37"/>men greatly abuſe them ſelues. When any of vs ſhall haue had a good beginning, we ſtraight wayes thinke that wee are at the higheſt: we neuer bethinke vs too pray any more to God, when as he hath ſhewed vs that fauour too ſerue our turnes: but if we haue doone any ſmall deede, wee by and by lift vp our ſayles, and woonder at our great vertues. To be ſhorte, wee thinke ſtraightway that the Deuill can winne no more of vs. This fooliſh arrogancie cauſeth God to let vs goe aſtray, ſo that wee fall mightily, yea that wee breake bothe armes and legges: and are in greate hazarde of breaking our neckes. I ſpeake not now of our naturall body, but of the ſoule. Let vs looke vpon Dauid him ſelfe: For he it is that hath made proofe heereof. It came too paſſe that he villanouſly and wickedly erred, when as hee toke Bethſabe the wife of his ſubiect Vry, to play the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger with her,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that hee was the cauſe of ſo execrable a murder, yea &amp; that of many: for he did aſmuch as in him lay, to haue the whole army of the Lorde and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſraell to bee vtterly ouerthrowne. Loe then too too great negligence and ſecuritie in Dauid: and ſee alſo wherefore hee ſayth, <hi>Alas my good God, I beſeech thee ſo to guide me, that I may forſake the way of lyings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the whole ſumme, that Dauid (although he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly profited in the lawe and word of God) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he was ſubiect and apt to be carryed away and abuſed: that the deuill might ſundry wayes beguile and deceaue him: that hee might bee ſeduced through many temptations: allured by the luſtes of the fleſhe: and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall, were it not that God did take from him the way of lying. Loe heere a poynte which we ought thorowly too mark, <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>take from me the way of lying.</hi> It is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to this ende, that euery of vs might knowe our owne wante: to wit, that we ſhould enter into our ſelues, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate after this manner. Goe to now, I am as a poore, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and ſo fraile a creature as is poſſible: my faith ſo very weake, and the luſtes of my fleſhe ſo ſtronge, as that they might haue ſudenly oppreſſed me. Alas my God, ſithens I
<pb facs="tcp:7694:38"/>am ſo weake and feeble, I muſt needs be aſſiſted by thee and by thy power and might. And againe howe many are our enemyes which moleſt and greeue vs? howe mightie and ſtrong is the Deuil? How great and infinite are the meanes wherewith he aſſayleth vs? and when hee ſhall aſſayle vs with his Dartes and arrowes, it is impoſſible for vs too eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape them, we ſhall become then like vnto the Lambe in the throte of the Lyon. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall thus haue vnderſtood theſe our wantes and needes, then may we ſay with Dauid, <hi>O Larde take from me the way of lying.</hi> Nowe he ſheweth the remedy when he ſayth: <hi>Cauſe me to make much of thy Lawe,</hi> or <hi>graunt me thy grace that I may keepe thy law:</hi> For the word which Dauid vſeth, importeth meere fauour and free gift: As if the ſhould haue ſaid, it commeth of thy meere fauour and grace, that thou giueſt me thy lawe.</p>
            <p>See heere the remedy which our lord and Sauiour vſeth, when he would withdraw vs from the law of lying, to wit, that we ſhould keepe his truth: For the truth of God is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently able to encounter al the ſubtelties and ſlye practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of Satan, to withſtande al temptations, and to vanquiſhe and ouercome al the luſtes of our fleſh. The trueth of God then wil ſuffice againſt al this. And this is it whiche Saint Paule ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.10.11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that when we ſhal be ſtr doctrine of the Goſpel, that then we ſhal haue wherwithall too bee Iuſty and ſtrong, and become valiant Champions too fight vnder thenſigne of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe ouer al our enimies. So then, wil we bee farre from hypocriſie? wil we be deliuered from lying, from al the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telties of Satan, and from al the deceits of the world? Let vs beſeeche God then to graunt vs his law, and to doo vs that good that we might be inſtructed therein, as wee are heere taught by the example of Dauid. Now after al this he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his proteſtation:</p>
            <q>That he hath choſen the way of trueth, and hath cleauen vnto the teſtimonies of God, that he hath folowed his iudgements: <hi>and heerevpon he beſeecheth him,</hi> not too bee confounded.</q>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:7694:38"/>
            <p>Heere now we ſee, that when we beſeech God to giue vs his law, to deliuer vs from temptations, to ſuffer vs not too be deceiued neither by Satan, nor the world, that we doe it with ſuch a true deſire, as Dauid ſheweth vs heere, in this place. For there are many which may ſay with their mouth, O Lord I would gladly reſiſt all temtations. But what? They compound with the Deuil, conſpire with him too ſet them ſelues againſt God, flatter them ſelues in all their iniquities, and deſire wholy to giue themſelues to all wickednes. Are not heere I beſeech you faire and proper petitions which we make with the mouth, when as the hart bendeth it ſelfe altogither to miſchiefe, and iniquitie. Is not this I pray you to mock God? what other thing elſe is it? Let vs then learne to ſay with Dauid, <hi>O Lord, I haue choſen the way of trueth, and haue ſticken to thy teſtimonies.</hi> When he ſayth, that hee hath choſen the way of trueth, hee meaneth that he deſined no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to follow that which was right and good, as God had ſhewed it vnto him. When he ſaith, that he cleaued to the teſtimonyes of God, he declareth what trueth that is whereof he made mention: For men many times imagine vnto them ſelues certaine fantaſie in their heads, and think the ſame to be the beſt &amp; moſt ſure fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation in the world, and that there is no other reaſon, trueth, nor wiſdome, but that which they haue conceiued in their owne braine. Let vs now beware of that, and aſſure our ſelues that trueth ſelfe is incloſed within the word of God, &amp; that that is it, which we muſt ſeeke: And not to haue vs thinke that to bee the trueth, which wee in our owne fantaſies doe iudge too bee good: but euen then haue wee choſen the way of trueth, when as we ſhall ſticke to the teſtimonies of God, when we ſhall vnderſtand and knowe that it is hee onely which may leade vs ſtraight, and that we haue doone this honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his woorde, to be ruled thereby all the dayes of our life. Loe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> howe we ſhoulde followe the way of trueth.</p>
            <p>Nowe when Dauid hath made all theſe proteſtations, hee deſireth that hee may bee confounded. As if hee ſhoulde haue ſayde, My GOD, ſince that it is ſo that I
<pb facs="tcp:7694:39"/>deſire to obey thee, ſuffer me not now to bee confounded, that I be not ſcorned, and ſuppoſed to bee as a vacabonde and without a guide, Loe heere a place which ought dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be marked: For I beſeech you, when we ſhall bee deſirous to cleaue vnto God and his word, when wee ſhall haue preferred the ſame before all our Iuſtes and pleaſures, yea aboue all whatſoeuer ſhall ſeeme good and right in our owne eyes: if wee ſhall then I ſay bee put to confuſion and ſhame, what ſhall become of vs when we ſhall laye the raine of the bridle in the necke of all our deſires, and take from God all his authoritie? Deſerue we not to bee vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded? No doubt we doe. So then, let vs way the firſte parte of this doctrine, that wee muſte not let our tongues walke againſt God: For he knoweth how to bee right well auenged thereof. How many doe we ſee at this day too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come after this manner ſo beaſtly, as that it is ſhame to ſee their brutiſhneſſe? and what is the cauſe? They haue caſt of the yoke of God, they haue not vouchſafed to do him that honor, as to bee gouerned by him: It is meete then that they be confounded in the open ſight of the worlde, that they may be pointed at, that euen young Children may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue their beaſtlyneſſe, and are very well woorthy ſo to be ſerued. And ſo leaſt wee fall into ſuch ſhame: let vs pray with Dauid, that it woulde pleaſe God to make vs ſo too ſtick vnto him and his woord, as we neuer be confounded. Nowe, too conclude with theſe eight verſes aparte, Dauid ſayth,</p>
            <q>I will runne the way of thy Comaundements: when thou ſhalt inlarge mine hearte.</q>
            <p>When he ſayth, That when God hath ſet his hearte at libertie, hee will runne: it is too ſhewe vnto vs, that when our heartes are incloſed and faſt ſhutte vp, that wee are not able ſo much as too remoue one of our fingers to well dooing, vntill ſuch time as GOD gladdeth vs, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs a mery countenaunce. Nowe Dauid in this firſte place declareth vnto vs, that wee are able to doe nothing except God ſtirreth vs vpp thereto.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:7694:39"/>
            <p>And although he hath already ſolicited &amp; admoniſhed vs, yet that is not all. We ſhould cry out and Alas: &amp; poure out ſome ſighes and grones. But becauſe God will be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a cheerefull minde, and not with an euill will, ſo long as we are faſt ſhut vp, we cannot once ſtirre out of the place, to goe on forwarde in the way of ſaluation. And how can we then runne? When as he ſhall haue ſet our heart at libertie: to wit, that he ſhal haue ſo diſpoſed &amp; ordered vs, as that we ſhould freely bend our ſelues, &amp; ſully &amp; wholy yeeld our affections vnto him. For otherwiſe, we hauing our harts faſt ſhut vp ſhal alwaies become the bondſlaues of ſin. It is very true, hat while we are in this world, we neuer run ſo faſt ne yet ſo perfectly, as is required, yea wee ſhall many times go as it were halting where in deede we ſhould make haſt. But thus it is with vs, that whenſoeuer he ſhall gouern vs with his ſpirit, and that we ſhall be vnder the conduct of our head &amp; Captaine Ieſus Chriſt, we may ſay with Dauid, that we doe not onely walke in his commaundements, but that we alſo runne in them: Yea, ſo that our affection bee not hypocritical, and that our zeale be alſo feruent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ourſelues vnto our good God, ſince he hath placed vs in the world to this end, to obey him, and too glorifie his holy name.</p>
            <p>And according to this doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the face of our good God, in acknowledging our ſinnes: beſeeching him, that it would pleaſe him to make vs to feele our ſinnes and iniquities more and more, &amp; that it would alſo pleaſe him to make vs ſo to remember them, that we may learne to acknowledge how neceſſary it is for vs to be more &amp; more encreaſed &amp; confirmed in his graces which he beſtoweth vpon vs, to the end that in allowing &amp; eſteeming of his benefites as it becommeth vs, we may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto him our humble and hearty thankes: beſeeching him alſo to continue vs in ſuch ſort in his holy vocation, as that we may be glorified in the latter day in hauing fought a good fight, and that we may inioy the prize &amp; rewarde of the victorie, to triumph in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Let
<pb facs="tcp:7694:40"/>vs beſeech him that he will not onely giue vs this grace, but alſo all the people and nations of the worlde, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe eight Verſes heere conteine the Prayers which wee haue already before ſeene: to witte, that Dauid prayeth too be taught in the lawe, that he might the better ſerue God. Nowe vpon this wee haue to note, that this is not all to heare
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7694:40"/>and to be taught by preaching vnto vs, that the ſame is as it were from the trueth of GOD: but wee muſt alſo be taught by the holie Ghoſte, yea and that twoo manner of wayes. For when God ſhall haue inlightened vs, to the end we might knowe that it commeth from him, it behooueth that he imprinte in our heartes a deſire too cleaue vnto it, for without that wee ſhall doe cleane contrary, as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are enclyned.</p>
            <p>So then, although it bee not ſuperfluous too reade and heare: yet wil it profite vs nothing at all, excepte the holy Ghoſte teacheth vs: yea and that to diſcerne aſwel betwene good and euill, as alſo to be wel and rightly affected, too walke according to the Commaundementes of GOD. Which thinge is ſufficiently confirmed vnto vs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Dauid: For (as wee haue heretofore declared) hee was a moſte excellent Prophet.</p>
            <p>Nowe it appeareth that hee was not onely ſufficiently inſtructed for him ſelfe, but GOD hadde alſo orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him too gouerne and inſtructe others: this was the Doctor of the whole Church. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hee confeſſeth him ſelfe too be vtterly ignoraunt and blinde, except God directed him by his holy ſpirite. Yea, and hee declareth vnto vs moſte plainely, that hee had neede of theſe twoo partes of the grace of GOD, heere by vs touched: to witte, to bee taught too knowe that which is good: and afterwarde too haue his minde fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to continue therein.</p>
            <p>This circumſtaunce alſo is ſpecially too bee noted, that Dauid in making his requeſtes heerein conteyned, was no Nouice: For God had already inſtructed him by his holy Spirite. And that which is more, he declareth that hee had already deſired too followe God, and too obay his Commaundementes . Wherefore then is it, that hee prayeth afreſhe, but onely that hee felte in him ſelfe greate weakeneſſe in this point, and that hee was but in the mid way?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:41"/>
            <p>Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnderſtand, that euen they which are inlightened by the ſpirit of God, &amp; are wel affected, ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues heerewith, as if they were already come to a ful perfection: but rather to acknowledge their weakenes, that they are not growne to that forwardnes, but that they may faile, and that it is God which cauſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to perſeuer and to be more and more confirmed. Loe heere, what wee haue yet to obſerue, by the example of Dauid. Nowe let vs follow the words which he vſeth; to the end the effect of this doctrine may the better be imprinted in our memoryes:</p>
            <q>Teach me O Lorde the way of thy ſtatutes: and I will keepe it vnto the end.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid declareth that he hath well begun to ſerue God, but he right wel feeleth that we are ſo frayle, that wee can neuer come home to the mark, without God ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs: wherfore he hath recourſe vnto this high &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power, by which God remedieth the vices that are in his choſen, which he knoweth, not to be in their nature. We ſee then, that when God ſtretcheth out his hande vnto vs, ſo that we haue alredy bin inſtructers &amp; teachers of our neigh bours, yet that we muſt not preſume of our owne power &amp; ſtrength, but ſtand alwaies vpon our garde beſeeching god with all humilitie and reuerence, that as he hath wel begun in vs, ſo he wil performe &amp; go through with the ſame. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſaid not, O Lord, I haue ſtrayed. But he hath very well ſaid heretofore, that he was by nature a wandring ſhepe: &amp; ſo ſhall we ſee him to be: And yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding our Lord had already brought him into the way of ſaluation, yea and had beſtowed vpon him excellent graces. But yet he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he might erre an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth times in a minute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God held him with a mightie hand: prayeth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed anew, as if all the reſt which hee had done had bin nothing. So then, when as God ſhal haue beſtowed vpon vs his graces, let vs not be negligent &amp; ſecure to lul our ſelues aſleepe, as though our ſtate and condition were not to bee amended. But let vs rather think with our ſelues and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he which hath bin taken and holden for a good &amp;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7694:41"/>vertuous man for the ſpace of ten or xx. yeeres might bee ſeene ouercome in a matter of nothing, were it not that God aſſiſted him.</p>
            <p>Loe here how the faithfull, after that God hath liberally beſtowed vpon them great graces, ought alwaies to walke in feare and humblenes, knowing that they are ſubiect to many temptations, which they are neuer able to reſiſt if God continued not the ſame in them, as well to inſtruct them, as alſo to ayde them with his power and ſtrength, &amp; to fortifie them more and more, as before I haue ſaid.</p>
            <p>And here we are diligently to marke this ſaying, <hi>And I will keepe it vnto the end.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid, My God, I haue already followed thy commaundementes for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein time: but what ſhall become of it, if thou doeſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes put too thy helping hand vnto me, as thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done? I may in one minute fall into a great and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſion. O Lord, I beſeeche thee therefore, that as thou haſt begunne well in me, ſo to perfourme the ſame throughly. By this we ſee what a diueliſh arrogancie that of the papiſtes is, wherewith they are puffed vp, when as to their ſeeming, that a man, after God hath once ſtretched out his arme vnto him, can by and by worke wonders of him ſelfe: and is ſufficiently able too ouercome all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But let vs rather vnderſtand and knowe, that euen as it is God that muſt beginne to ſet vs in the right way, ſo likewiſe that we cannot continue and abide therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he alwayes holde vs by his mightie hand, and neuer to ſuffer Satan to ſeduce vs, neither yet to bee wickedly led, by his ſubtelties and wyles. And thus much as touching the firſt verſe Now it followeth:</p>
            <q>Giue me vnderſtanding and I will keepe thy lawe: yea I will keepe it with my whole hart.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid declareth vnto vs in the firſt place, what our true wiſedome is: to wit, that we ſhould walke in the feare of God: as alſo it is ſaid in the ſcripture, That the feare of God is true wiſedome: In ſumme, wee haue here the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of Dauid, that al they which withdrawe themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:7694:42"/>from the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, are people voide of wit, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wiſedome, and reaſon. In very deede wee ſhall neuer haue the worlde to iudge thus of it: For wee will ſaye, loe this is a witty fellow, this man is very wyſe, when hee is able to beguile his neighbours, and craftily inuent, how to giue himſelfe too all iniquitie. Such is the wyſedome of this worlde. But in the meane whyle let vs note this by the way, that theſe woordes are not ſpoken without cauſe, too witte, that al our wyſedome and reaſon conſiſteth heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that wee walke in the feare of God, and ſeeke after his wil, yea and too holde vs too it. In the ſecond place as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid hath already proteſted, that wee are not capable to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande the lawe of God, and the contentes thereof, if wee bee not taught from aboue, that is, by the holy ghoſt: hee alſo addeth, that hee can haue no good affection nor deſire to giue himſelfe thereto, vntil ſuch tyme as his heart bee reformed.</p>
            <p>The law of God may ſeeme to be but a common thing, yea we our ſelues do ſee, that the proude men of this world contemne it as a thing too too common: But yet, as Dauid hath before ſaid, God hath ſet downe vntoo vs in his lawe wonderful ſecretes, which hee heere repeteth not in vaine, that it muſt needes bee that in receiuing the ſpirite of God from heauen, hee ſhoulde bee conducted, to the ende to followe the commaundementes of God. Nowe he namely ſaith. <hi>That I will keepe, yea that I will keepe it with my whole hart.</hi> This is no ſuperfluous repetition, when he ſaieth, That I wil keepe, yea that I wil keepe it with my whole harte. For beholde what it is that abuſeth a great number of men, ſo that they cannot be reprehended by men, that their life is not ſo diſſolute as that they may bee pointed at, and bee not brought to rebuke and ſhame: Loe theſe men bee lyke little Angelles. They make themſelues belieue, that they are more then iuſt before God: they feele themſelues guiltie in nothing. For this cauſe then Dauid hauing ſaid that he wil kepe the lawe of God, declareth, that it is not ſo common a thing to doo as we take it.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:7694:42"/>
            <p>And why ſo? For ſaith he, he muſt keepe it with his whole heart. When he meaneth to ſhewe vnto vs what the good keeping of the law of GOD is, and ſuch an obſeruation as God requireth of vs, it is not onely meant that our feete and handes ſhould be ſeene to bee well ruled and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that our ſinnes and iniquities ſhould be ſo apparaunt, as that they might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned in the ſight of the world: this ſay I, is not all, as to vſe ſuch an obſeruation. But wee muſt (ſaith Dauid) keepe the lawe of God with our whole heart. When as we ſhalbe neuer ſo litle affected or deſirous thereto, it ſhalbe a great deale more worth then all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the worlde. But we muſt beware that we haue not a double heart, that our deſire be ſo colde and feeble, as to ſay, very well, I would gladly that God would beſtowe his grace vpon me that I might followe his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: and thereupon, to ſhewe our ſelues wearie and ſlougthfull: but we muſt haue a true ſinceritie to walke therein with all fulnes and integritie. But I beſeeche you what is he that is able to attaine to that perfection? It is ſo farre of that there ſhould be any ſuch vprightnes in vs, as that we are not able to thinke once a good thought, except God chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth our peruerſe nature, which before ſhould be repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto his righteouſneſſe. Wherefore, in ſumme, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, after that he had prayed vnto God that he woulde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, to the ende hee might keepe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: addeth, for a more ample confirmation:</p>
            <q>That I may keepe thy commaundementes with my whole heart.</q>
            <p>As if he ſhould haue ſaide, O Lorde I knowe that we men, as we are puffed vp with pride and arrogancie, doe thinke vs too haue accompliſhed and fulfilled all the whole lawe, when as wee haue ſet a good countenaunce of the matter, and haue made ſome apparaunce or ſhewe to the worlde: if there were no more in it but this, yet ſhoulde it be enough for mee, conſidering that all our members doe ſo rage in wickedneſſe, as that it is very harde too holde them in. But all this ſhoulde bee nothing. For it ſhoulde be all but meere hypocriſie: and bycauſe that thou
<pb facs="tcp:7694:43"/>haſt reſpect to the heart, all my carnall paſsions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions muſt be pulled down &amp; my ſelfe in ſuch ſort renued, as that I may be wholy conformed vnto thy righreouſnes. Alas my God, and if I muſt be brought to that, I ſee it to be an impoſsible matter. And ſo thou muſt needes put thy helping hand vnto me, that I might be taught by thy holy ſpirite. It followeth in the thirde verſe,</p>
            <q>Make me to goe in the waye of thy commaundements: for therein is my deſire.</q>
            <p>Here we ſee that which hath beene touched, to wit, that Dauid prayeth not vnto God that he would beginne to ſet him in a good way: For he was already entred into it, hee had already walked in it a good long ſeaſon. And in deede, this deſire is a very great furtherance vnto vs, when as wee may praye vnto God to beſeeche him to gouerne vs, and we ought to preferre this felicitie or bleſſednes before all the things in the worlde. And herein let vs ſhewe our ſelues to haue greatly profited. Now Dauid proteſteth, without hypocriſie, that he hath kept the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God: Neuertheleſſe he beſeecheth the Lord to graunt vnto him power to perſeuer therein, and that hee may come to the perfection thereof. Wherein wee ſee that it is not enough that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath begunne and ſet vs in a good way, that we may euer after doe what ſoeuer ſeemeth good in our owne ſight. We ſee here to the contrary, that when God ſhall haue taught vs, and that we haue beene apt to learne from the beginning: neuertheleſſe that his grace ſhoulde be made voide euery minute, without hee did continue it. And ſo in the firſt place, when as God ſhall haue inſtructed vs, to make vs to come to a good vnderſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he muſt alſo graunt vnto vs a good affection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. And hath he giuen vs that? It is alſo meete that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame in vs, and make vs deſirous to walke in his commaundementes. Finally after that he hath giuen vs to will, the muſt alſo giue vs to perfourme as S. Paul ſaith, that he doe all in all, but not to rewarde this good will or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good preparation which is in vs, but to doe it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7694:43"/>to his pleaſure, to wit, of his free mercie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let vs on our behalf conſider, when as wee would obteine any ſuch grace at Gods handes: to witte, to leade vs into the way of his pathes, that our hearts be there ſetled as that we be not ſo accurſed as to forſake God, and to ſet light by him, to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che this light which he ſhal haue put in vs. For otherwiſe, if wee bee alwayes giuen to the vanities of this world, as commonly we are, and that wee make no accompte of the graces which God ſhall beſtowe vppon vs: it is good reaſon, that hee take them from vs, and ſet vs cleane without them, yea and that hee take his holy ſpirite from vs, although we had bene before endued with the ſame. He added ſoone after,</p>
            <q>Enclinemy heart vnto thy teſtimonies: and not vnto coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe.</q>
            <p>Here we ſee how it hath already byn taught, that God muſt haue the gouernement of all the partes of man: that it is not enough that he giue him a good witt, to the ende to iudge that which is good, but his courage and minde muſt alſo be tied thereto. He hath ſaid before, Giue me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: and by and by, Encline my heart vnto thy te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies. And to what ende ſhould he encline it? Let vs here note that it is the office of God, to encline our heartes vnto his ordinances, or els, they would goe cleane againſt the haire. For if we were diſpoſed of our ſelues to walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wil of God, to hold &amp; conceiue whatſoeuer is written in his worde, Dauid needed neuer to haue made this requeſt, or els he ſhould ſpeake it faynedly and after a lying maner. When then the beſought God to encline his heart to well doing: it is as much, as if he had confeſſed &amp; ſaid, It is not in me, O Lord, neither yet in any mortal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to walke as thou haſt commaunded, for our heartes are altogether peruerſe and wicked. There is nothing in vs but rebellion and treaſon againſt thee, wee ſhall neuer be able to walke in thy obedience, nor neuer place ourſelues therein, except thou putteſt to thy hand, and enclineſt our mindes and heartes thereto. We ſee then what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion
<pb facs="tcp:7694:44"/>and diſobedience of mans nature againſt God is, vntill ſuch time as hee hath ſoftened our ſtony and flinty heartes and that we haue learned to beare his yoke: to bee ſhort, that our heartes be ſo abaſed and humbled, as that wee haue learned to hate that which is euill, and to deſire that which is good. Loe, what is declared vnto vs in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>Nowe when Dauid ſpeaketh here of couetouſnes, hee ſheweth vnto vs that theſe thinges can abide no fellowſhip together, as to followe the word of God, &amp; to be giuen to the goodes of this world. In very deede, he putteth in here one kinde for al the whole. But in the firſt place, let vs note, that in oppoſing againſt the keeping of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, that, which he knewe to be cleane contrary vnto it: he meaneth to declare that wee are intangled with ſo many vices and deſires, as is moſt lamentable. And to ſay the truthe, what are the appetites and deſires of men? when as we ſhall haue called out euery of them by their ſelfe, we ſhall finde nothing in them but a mere contrarietie to reſiſt die Lorde our God. For looke howe many thoughtes and affections are in vs, they are euen ſo many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre to fight againſt God. So then Dauid acknowledged, that he can not ſerue God, vntil ſuch time as he be clenſed, from all his euill deſires, and vitious affections, and therefore he beſeecheth God to expell out of him, that peruerſeneſſe which he felt in him ſelfe, that he was ouermuch giuen to couetouſnes, and to ſuch other like things. And thus much for this firſt point.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo, when as wee would followe God, let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that we can not do it without great conflict: to wit, vntill ſuch time as all our paſsions are mortified. For out heart will neuer place it ſelfe rightly, vntill ſuch time as our nature be brought vnder. True it is, that wee muſt not ſerue God either by force or conſtraynedly. Yea, but let vs ſee howe wee doe ſerue him, Are wee thereunto enclined as of our ſelues? Alas, it is nothing ſo, vntill ſuch tyme as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7694:44"/>he hath renued in vs our minde and will. For ſo long as we remaine in this our nature, all our ſenſes are ſtirred vp to doe euill: ſo that, as I haue before ſaid, wee ſhall neuer bee able to ſerue God, in captiuing our affections, and holding them in, as pryſoners: to the end wee be not letted to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that which God hath commaunded vs.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come to the ſecond point. Bicauſe that ſome vices are greater then other ſome, and ſithens that euery man may be giuen more to one vice then to an other: let vs keepe good watche, and warde, and ſtande vppon our garde. If there be any man that feeleth a vice to reigne in him ſelfe, let him vnderſtand and ſaye, loe a combat euen ready at hand: and ſo let euery other man doe the like. As how? If a man haue a great number of ſeruants vnder him, he wil appoint euery one his taſke: hee will appoint to one man this thing, to another that thing, and euery of them muſt beſtowe him ſelfe accordingly as hee is appointed. Euen ſo is it in an army: Some are appointed to wayte vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ordinaunce, ſome other are harquebuziers, ſome are horſemen, and other ſome armed pykes, or otherwiſe. Now euery of theſe muſt haue regarde whereunto to applie him ſelfe, and the ſame is looked for at his hand. Euen ſo it is with vs, when as any vice warreth againſt vs: for it is as much, as if God addreſſed vs to be exerciſed therewith, to the ende wee might fight againſt it. No doubte, there is not that man, which hath not in him ſelfe ſome one roote of all kinde of wickedneſſe, and this is a bottomleſſe pitte wherein we are all confounded. But yet, as I haue before ſaide, there are vices which more plentifully doe abounde in one more then in another. Euery man therefore ought to haue great regarde, whereunto his nature is moſt encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo much the more enforce him ſelfe to reſiſt all thoſe temptations, wherewith hee may bee moſt cruſſhed and ſhaken. And that which is more, wee muſt haue reſpect to thoſe wicked affections and thoughtes, which might in any wyſe deceiue vs by occaſions offered vs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:45"/>
            <p>It is not like to be true that Dauid was naturally coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, neither yet do we finde that he was ſo. But wee reade that he was a king, that he had a fertile and plentifull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and that he might haue gathered together exceding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as we alſo ſee he did. When men come to wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches after that maner, it is great perill, but that they will giue them ſelues too too much thereto, where before they had them in contempt. Euen ſo then, it may be that Dauid had a care to deſire to be more welthy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was, although as the ſcripture witneſſeth, that Gold and ſiluer was then little ſet by: For he had ſuch plenty of them, as that golde and ſiluer were no better accompted off the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leade or earth. He then ſeeing him ſelfe to haue ſo great occaſions to bee giuen and drawne vnto couetouſnes, was the more carefull to pray vnto God to deliuer him from it. Wee haue now to gather out of this place a good and holſome doctrine, that they which are choſen to dignitie and honour, ought to haue great regard that they bee not ouertaken with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby they might ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be both migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and noble touching the worlde. And againe, that they which are welthy and riche, bee not giuen ouer vnto their wealth, as in another place of the Pſalme is ſaid. If thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in riches, ſet not thine heart on them. And alſo that they which might bee ouertaken with their pleaſures and delightes, ſhould keepe an hard hand on the bridle, and be well aduiſed that they abuſe not the goodes which GOD hath beſtowed on them.</p>
            <p>Loe here, ſay I, in the firſt place how euery man ought to bridle his nature, to the ende to reſiſt and withſtande the vices and ſinnes, whereunto he is enclined. And next, as euery one hauing lettes or occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to exceede, they ought to keepe ſo much the better watche ouer them ſelues. For, as I haue already ſaide, albeit that euery of vs is giuen more to one vice then to another, yet for all that, we are euery of vs contagiouſly infected with them all, &amp; there is not that man which can exempt him ſelfe from the ſame. Now it is true in deede, that Dauid here ſpeaketh namely
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7694:45"/>of couetouſnes. And why ſo? Bicauſe it is a vice which bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth exceeding many miſchiefes. And it is not without cauſe, that S. Paul calleth it the roote of all euill: For after that a man is once giuen to the peſtilent couetouſnes of the goodes of this world,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10.</note> he maketh an Idol of his money, riches, and poſſeſsions. He is ſo violently carried away with them, as that he will neuer be ſatiſfied. Hee is like vnto a bottomleſſe depth which neuer wilbe filled. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it maketh him to be full of crueltie, hauing neither pitie nor compaſſion of his neighboures, making neyther conſcience nor doubt to fal out with God and the worlde, ſo that he may haue them, al ſhalbe one to him. Let vs note then, that if there bee any vice which hindreth vs from the ſeruing of God, this is it: to wit, this couetous deſire of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting worldly goods. Now Dauid (after he hath ſpoken ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of couetouſnes) ſaith,</p>
            <q>Turne away myne eyes from beholding of vanitee: and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me in thy way.</q>
            <p>When as Dauid prayeth that his eyes might bee turned away, leaſt he beheld vanitie: It is as if he ſhould haue ſaide, Alas, my God, I had neede too withſtand a thouſande te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, yea and they are infinite which may come before me, and that the deuill may preſent me with: to the ende I might bee wickedly ledde, from ſeruing of thee, if there were nothing els but this, it muſt needes bee that I muſt haue beene vanquiſhed a thouſand times, if thou haddeſt not inſtructed me, and that I had beene ſtrengthened with thy mightie hand: And yet O Lord, behold two gates open to receiue in the enemies. I beſeeche thee, O Lorde, that whenſoeuer we ſhalbe aſſailed with an huge armie, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not of our ſelues able to reſiſt them, and that in ſteade to be in ſome moſt ſure place, where we might repulſe and beate backe our enemies, the gates ſhall ſtande wyde open to let them in: to what purpoſe were all this? Euen ſo is it in this caſe, for the two eyes of man are as it were the twoo gates whereat the enemies enter. And to what ende ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:7694:46"/>it be, when as wee ſhall haue neither power nor abilitie too reſiſt, and goe out againſt them. And ſo, ſince we haue ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies euen lurking within our ſelues, and that wee are not onely weake, but that there is nothing els but weakenes in vs: and are alſo thruſt out as it were for a praye too Satan, when we ſhall ſee theſe twoo gates ſtand ſo wyde open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the aſſaultes wherewith he aſſaileth vs, wee haue very great neede to praye vnto God (after the example of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid) to turne away our eyes, leaſt they behold vanitie. Let vs then vnderſtande, that the meaning of Dauid is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs in this place, that the eyes of men are alwayes bent to beholde vanitie: that is to ſaye, that they are euer carried away to all euill, to all wicked concupiſcenſes, vntill ſuch time as God turneth them away. Yea, and our eyes are not onely gates to receiue all euill: but are euen meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers alſo. As if the gates were not only open, but that there were alſo traytors within, to giue intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to inſtruct the enemies. Loe where and which waye you muſt come: and which waye you muſt enter. Euen ſo is it with our eyes: our eyes receiue on the one ſide the enemies, and on the other ſide, they ſende meſſages euen from the bottom of the heart, to enuenime and poyſon vs all ouer. So then, we ſee howe neceſſarie this requeſt is for vs all, as Dauid hath made before vs. But according as euery man moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in the knowledge of God: ſo much the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth he this doctrine: and they which knowe and vnderſtande leaſt herein, ſhall be they which will preſume greatlieſt of their owne power and ſtrength. But contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when God ſhall haue giuen, and liberally beſtowed vpon vs many of his graces, it ſhould be to this ende, that wee might ſo much the better vnderſtande our miſeries and calamities: beſeeching him to remedy the ſame, and too make prouiſion for vs againſt all our euils and vices, Nowe he addeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quicken thou me in thy wye,</hi> as in the ende hee ſayeth, quicken thou me in thy rightuouſneſſe. This may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7694:46"/>twoo maner of wayes: <hi>Quicken thou mee in thy waye,</hi> to witte, O Lorde, make me to walke in thy woorde, that I may lyue. Or els: O Lorde, giue mee ſtrength, to the ende I may followe thy woorde. We knowe that when we withdrawe our ſelues from God, we can not but committe all iniquitie, for which is the waye of life but euen that which God ſheweth vs, and calleth vs vnto? All they then which forſake the worde of God, goe aſtraye, and runne headlong vnto death, and into euerlaſting deſtruction. Euen ſo, it is not without cauſe, that Dauid deſireth to bee quickened in the waye of the Lorde: as if he ſhoulde haue ſayde, that all they which forſake the Lorde, and the waye which hee ſheweth them, are vndone, and vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. But according to the true meaning of the place, wee are to note that Dauid his meaning is rather to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto vs, that all men of them ſelues, are as it were dead, that they haue no power nor ſtrength when there is any queſtion of walking according to the will of God.</p>
            <p>True it is, that in all euill, wee are therein too too puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt and ſtrong, and ſo diligent in it as in nothing more: to be ſhort, there is not that hee, which is not therein too too able: But when wee meane to walke according to the commaundementes of God, wee are not able once to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue a finger: our armes and legges ſhalbe cleane bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: to be ſhort, wee are not onely weake in this, but alſo vtterly dead therein.</p>
            <p>The Papiſtes will confeſſe, that men are weake, and not able to ſatiſfie the lawe of God, except they be ayded: and thinke it ſufficient enough, if God giue them a ſigne to ayde their weakeneſſe, as if a man ſhoulde reache his hande to a young infant, and ſaye vnto him, come he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my prety childe, and hee commeth, and the other maketh ſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as though he would take him by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to leade him, &amp; yet ſuffereth him to go alone by himſelfe. Loe howe the Papiſtes haue diminiſhed the graces of GOD. But contrariwiſe, the ſcripture telleth, vs that
<pb facs="tcp:7694:47"/>we are as dead men, to witte, that there is in vs no ſtrength nor habilitie at all. And therefore Dauid deſireth to be quickened in the way of the Lord. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, O Lorde, my life is altogither giuen to wickedneſſe. For all my power and ſtrength bendeth and diſplaieth it ſelfe thereto. Euen ſo, O Lord, ſince thou graunteſt vnto mee a cleane contrarie kinde of life: to witte, that I endeuour my ſelfe to ſerue thee, graunt me now, O Lord, that I be earneſt and feruent, where before I was very ſlow and dull, yea, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> altogether weake and impotent. Nowe hee goeth on and ſayeth:</p>
            <q>Eſtabliſhe thy promiſe to thy ſeruant, bicauſe he feareth thee.</q>
            <p>When as he deſireth God to eſtabliſh his worde in him, and with this addition that he may feare God, hee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the requeſtes which he had before made. Nowe wee ought to carie this point alwayes in minde, that when wee meane to praye vnto God, wee muſt laye our foundation vpon his promiſes. We muſt deſire nothing of him, but that we are already aſſured that hee will giue it vs, that hee hath of his owne good will promiſed vs without our requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof firſt. For it were foolehardines to preſent our ſelues before the Lord our God, and to make our petitions after our owne pleaſures: but it is mete that God him ſelfe preuent, and ſpeaketh firſt vnto vs. Herevpon then we may aſſure our ſelues to praye when as wee haue his woorde for it.</p>
            <p>According to which reaſon, Dauid after he had made his requeſtes as we haue heard, addeth, <hi>O Lord, eſtabliſhe thy worde in thy Seruant.</hi> As if he ſhoulde haue ſaide, O Lorde, I deſire nothing of thee, but that which thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. And loe it is it that maketh mee ſo bolde too come vnto thee, bicauſe I knowe that thou art faithfull, and wilt too doe vnto mee euen as thou haſt promiſed. Wherefore as the promiſſes of GOD ought to giue vs an entrance into our prayers, and alwayes to go on: euen ſoo alſo after that wee haue prayed, lette vs call too minde his owne promiſſes, to the ende wee may bee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7694:47"/>aſſured that it ſhall not be in vaine, that wee haue required of him. And why ſo? Bicauſe that God of his owne free good will, hath bounde him ſelfe vnto vs, there is no doubt but that we ſhall obtaine, conſidering that he will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhe whatſoeuer he hath ſaide, for he can not fayle vs. Loe then the meaning of the beginning of this verſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe when Dauid ſaieth <hi>that he may feare the Lord,</hi> he meaneth not that he would here alledge his merites: but he doth it to this ende, to declare that hee hath followed the ſame vocation whereunto he was called: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee ſheweth, that hee coulde not walke in the feare of God, but by the vertue and power of the holy ghoſt, which was continually in him. And euen ſo muſt wo alſo do. For whenſoeuer we ſhall feele any good zeale in vs, wee muſt not bragge vpon it: for what haue wee that wee haue not receiued: according to the ſaying of Paul? For what is it that ſhould ſeparate vs, that we ſhould not be like vnto the moſt wicked? commeth it of our owne nature? no ſurely. It muſt needes be then, that it is God which hath put to his helping hand. And ſo, whatſoeuer goodneſſe is in vs, it is a teſtimonie of the good will which God beareth vs, and that he wilbe our father and Sauiour. Loe here why Dauid ſetteth this foremoſt, as though he would ratifie the promiſſes of God. Now he concludeth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Take away my rebuke that I am afraide of: for thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are good.</l>
               <l>Behold I deſire thy commandements: O quicken mee in thy righteouſneſſe.</l>
            </q>
            <p>We ſhal neuer be able to knowe, what the rebuke which Dauid here ſpeaketh of is, except we haue regard whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his whole drifte heretofore tendeth, and too what ende: to witte, that God would defende and keepe him, and alſo guide him, as it were with his hande, to the ende that as he had begunne well, hee might alſo in like maner perſeuer and continue. Nowe the ſhame which all the faithfull ought to feare is, that God ſuffereth them not to be confounded: that when they haue for a certaine time
<pb facs="tcp:7694:48"/>walked well, they might not in the ende giue them ſelues to wickedneſſe: that the latter part of their life might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that it was not well and ſurely rooted within, but was hypocriticall and diſſembled.</p>
            <p>Behold the rebuke which Dauid feared, to wit, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had walked well, that God would not leaue him as a confounded man: And namely he ſayth, <hi>For thy iudgements are good.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide, Alas, my God, ſo that I followe the ſame which thou haſt commaunded mee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that men ſpeake euill of me and ſlaunder me for it, all is one to mee, when as my conſcience ſhalbe pure and cleane, and that thou art my warrant and witneſſe, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough\ for me. Behold then, O my God, the rebuke from which I deſire to be deliuered, to witte, that thou ſuffer me not to be wickedly giuen, nor that I depart from thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements: but let my life and conuerſation be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thy worde. O that ſuffiſeth me: and let men ſpeake what them liſte, their iudgement is falſe, and I appeale from them.</p>
            <p>Then to conclude he ſaieth, <hi>My delight is in thy comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementeſſe: O quicken me in thy righteousness.</hi> The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God oftentimes is taken for the grace which God vſeth towardes his children, or at the leaſtwiſe wherewith he conducteth them. But he ſetteth downe righteouſneſſe here, for right, and equitie. Hee hath ſaide before, <hi>quicken me according to thy woorde:</hi> Nowe by and by after followeth <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> Neyther muſt we thinke this to bee ſtraunge, for we haue ſhewed here before, that Dauid ſpeaking of the commaundementes of GOD, after that he hath vſed his terme namely of theſe woordes, ordinaunces and ſtatutes, he taketh other wordes. As in this place, after he hath ſaid, <hi>quicken me in thy worde,</hi> he ſayeth ſoone after, <hi>In thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> And he maketh alſo this requeſt, <hi>that hee might bee conducted in the way of the Lord.</hi> Whereby hee would ſhewe, that it is not enough that we be wel affected, but that God muſt encreaſe the ſame in vs, yea, hee muſt conduct and quicken vs, as here he telleth vs. For it is ſo farre off, that of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7694:48"/>our ſelues we can doe any good, that we are not able once to thinke a good thought, as S. Paul ſaith.</p>
            <p>Loe then, how Dauid deſired to be quickened: but that was in proteſting that he was as touching him ſelfe and his owne nature, but as it were a condemned man.</p>
            <p>And herein muſt we alſo do the like. For wee muſt goe vnto our good God as men condemned in our ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him that he would quicken vs. And when he ſhall haue cauſed vs to feele his grace, and that wee haue ſtayed our ſelues thereon, let vs ſay, we beſeeche thee O Lord, that ſince it hath pleaſed thee to beginne in vs well doing, that thou wouldeſt alſo perfourme the ſame in vs. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this doctrine let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the Maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging our faultes: Beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him to make vs feele our miſerie and wretchedneſſe, whereunto wee are giuen whiles we liue here in this world: to the end we may walke ſo fearefully and carefully as that wee may be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that wee haue receiued ſome fauour and grace from our God, and that in following the right way which hee hath ſhewed vnto vs, wee may daily more and more aſpire to the ende which he hath ſet before vs, which is to attaine to that immortall glorie, to conioyne vs vnto our head and captaine our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, after that he ſhall haue deſpoyled vs of all the vices and imperfections of our fleſh, and cloathe vs with his righteouſnes. And that he will not onely graunt vs this grace, but alſo vnto all people and nations of the world, &amp;c.</p>

As if he ſhould haue ſaid, O Lord, declare vnto me, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe which thou haſt made vnto me to do me ſo much good, be not in vaine, but that thou wilt make me feele in deede, that thy word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is moſt certaine and true. Now, that he founded him ſelf vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the promiſes of God, appeareth by his thus ſaying:</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7694:49"/>
            <q>
               <l>And let thy louing kindeneſſe come vnto me, O Lord: and thy ſaluation, according to thy promiſe.</l>
               <l>So ſhall I make anſwere vnto my blaſphemers: for my truſt is in thy worde.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Wherein alſo we ſee that Satan craftely goeth aboute to ouerthrow his faith, as if God had made it nothing worth. So then, Firſt of all we are to note, that Dauid feeling him ſelfe preſſed downe, runneth vnto the promiſes of God. And this is a poynt very profitable for vs. For beholde how we muſt put the word of God in practiſe, when as we haue learned it, that when we come to the fight, and Satan aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs on euery ſide, in ſuch ſort as that it might ſeeme that all the worlde had conſpyred againſt vs, and that wee ſee nothing but deſtruction rounde about: Euen then, I ſay, muſt we run vnto the promiſes which God hath made vs, and make accounte of them, and ſo apply them to our own vſe, that then wee may feele the power and ſtrength of them. Nowe it ſhall be an eaſy matter for vs, when as wee are at reſt and quiet, to receiue whatſoeuer God hath ſaide vnto vs. And why ſo? Becauſe our Faith all that while ſhall not be exerciſed and troubled, ſo that we ſhall neuer bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to feele whether we haue beleeued in good earneſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as we are tryed. Loe, Why I haue ſaid that this place is worthy the marking, that Dauid ſpeaketh not with out cauſe when he ſayth, So ſhall I make anſwere vnto thoſe that go about to ſha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e me. For by theſe words he proteſteth, that the wicked conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, deſpiſed &amp; mocked him, as if he had bin a very foole, in truſting ſo much vnto God, but yet for that, his faith was not ſhaken. And ſee how Satan aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs with temptations, when as the wicked and vngodly ſpeake reprochfull woordes of vs: inſomuch as wee haue thought it to be woonderfull ſtraunge geere, becauſe that we hauing hearde the ſo honourable &amp; excellent promiſes of God, thought our ſelues ſtraightwayes to bee rapte and caryed aboue the cloudes, and yet this ſame our perſuaſion proued nothing at all ſo, as it made a ſhewe to the outward apparance: Euen ſo likewiſe came it to paſſe in Dauid, as

            <p>And our Sauiour Chriſt alſo, who is the very true patern and mirrour of all the Children of God hath ſuſtained &amp; abiden ſuch combates. Very well (ſaid they vnto him) hee truſteth in God, Let him nowe ſee whether God will heare him or not. Let vs then note, that Dauid hath not deuiſed and made here any vaine ſpeculations, as an idle body might doe, which neuer had beene tempted nor diſtreſſed. But beeing ſo mocked by his enemyes, that his faith ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ouerthrowne, and he him ſelfe in great hazarde vtterly to be deſtroyed, then came he for refuge to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, ſaying: My God, thou haſte giuen mee thy worde, which cannot fayle me: Loe wherein is all hope and truſt. Euen ſo alſo ought we to followe this doctrine, too wit, when the worlde on the oneſide ſhall deride and ſcorne vs, becauſe we haue ouer lightly credited God, and that Satan ſhall trauel all he can too turne vs cleane away from the certaintie which wee haue had: yet let vs not ceaſe too ſay, O Lord, it is thou which haſt ſpoken, and in thee is all our hope and truſt.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, as wee are to call too minde the promiſes of God, when as wee are aſſayled by Satan and the vngodly: Let vs alſo note (as hath beene heeretofore treated of) that this is it whereon we muſt builde al our requeſts: For if we will earneſtly pray vnto God, and obtaine that which wee pray for, we muſt not pray in the ayre, &amp; ſay, O Lord I pray vnto thee for ſuch a thing, and I would it might ſo come to paſſe. For this were ouer raſh and too too great boldeneſſe to think to make God ſubiect to our willes, to briddle him as we liſt, and to deſire him to graunte vs whatſoeuer ſhall pleaſe our appetites: but it is his worde that muſt leade vs, and be our Creſſet: and we muſt referre our ſelues wholy to it, and altogither reſt thereon. Beholde, ſay I, after what ſort our prayers are allowed, to wit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we pray not to God for that which ſeemeth beſt in our owne eyes, but when as we be fenced with that which he hath promiſed vs.</p>
            <p>And this is it, wherein we differ from the Painimes and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7694:51"/>Infidels. For wee ſee that the Turkes and Idolaters doe greatly pray vnto God. But after what manner pray they? Forſooth euen at all aduenture: ſo that they knowe not what they doe. But contrariwiſe wee muſt pray vnto him, with full aſſuraunce that he will heare vs. But from whence ſhall this certaintie proceede, if wee haue not the trueth to goe before vs, and ſay: beholde the Lorde, who calleth vs vnto him? And then when wee come vnto him, this is no fooliſh preſumption: But we come in ſuch ſorte vnto him, as he hath commaunded vs.</p>
            <p>Let vs then ſee what wee haue yet to note in this place, when Dauid ſetteth downe heere the promiſes of God, by which he is bounde vnto him: <hi>O Lorde,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>let it bee doone vnto me according to thy worde.</hi> Nowe heere is a very profitable poynt to be conſidered off: to witte, after that we are once aſſured, that God hath promiſed too doe that for vs which we ſhall aſke of him, we muſt no more doubt, that it ſhall be ſo: but that the thing is fully concluded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that we are euer ſure and certaine thereof. For when God ſpeaketh vnto vs, we are very ſure, that he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs: hee will not giue vs faire woordes, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, as men many times doe, dealing very liberally with their tongues, but yet notwithſtanding very cloſe fiſted: But God dealeth not in ſuch ſorte. Let vs then come before him without diſtruſt, Haue wee his woorde? Let vs then holde the thing as already performed. And ſo when Dauid ſayth, <hi>according to thy word,</hi> hee ſignifieth vnto vs, that hee was not onely aſſured, that God is faithfull and liberal, that he meaneth not to abuſe vs when as wee truſte to him: but ſheweth vs, that this certaintie which wee haue of the trueth of God, ſhould not make vs weary, to ſay, that wee bee as it were euen ouerwhelmed. But wee muſt rather be carefull and diligent to pray vnto him.</p>
            <p>There are ſome men which will in deede ſay, that they beleeue the promiſes of GOD, but ſince, ſay they, hee knoweth what wee haue neede of, what neede wee to bee importune vppon him.</p>

            <p>Nowe theſe men indeede, very well declare, that they neuer vnderſtood what faith and hope are. For if we receiued the promiſes of God without hypocriſie we ought to be thus earneſt and zealous, to pray, and haue recourſe vnto him, ſaying, O Lorde God, when as thou haſt aſſured mee of thy bountie and mercie, it is to this end, that I ſhould call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee in my neede. And that I ſee the neceſſitie which vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and preſſeth mee, I muſte needes come vnto thee as thou haſte called mee by thy worde. Beholde then, that all the promiſes of God ſhould ſerue vs in ſtede of ſo many ſpurres to prick vs forwarde, in making our prayers vnto him. Let vs nowe come to the woords of Dauid.</p>
            <q>Let thy louing mercyes, <hi>or</hi> thy graces, come vnto me O Lord, and thy ſaluation.</q>
            <p>After that he hath layde his foundation wherevpon too builde, he deſireth one ſelfe ſame thing in two words, which to the outwarde apparance are diuers and ſundry: to wit, the graces of God, and his ſaluation. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Dauid meneth nothing elſe, but that god would ſhew him ſelfe to be his Sauiour. Neither is there any thing heere ſpoken ſuperfluouſly: For it is aſmuch as if he had ſayd, O my God, I beſech thee that according to thy promiſe, thou wilt make me feele thee to be my ſauiour and father. But yet in the meane while, he expreſſeth vnto vs whence this ſaluation which we muſt wayte for, and whiche God hath promiſed vs cometh, and that is, of his meere good will. For men cannot otherwiſe chooſe: but that they wil euer wrongfully take vpon them ſome thing or other, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth nothing vnto them, and alwayes to be fooliſhly and arrogantly bounde vnto them ſelues. Nowe Dauid, cleane contrary, ſheweth heere, that all the ſaluation which he hopeth after &amp; deſireth, commeth from another ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade, then from the vertue and dignitie of men: to wit, euen from the meere goodnes of God. So then wee ſee, that as before he hath ſpoken of the promiſe, euen ſo alſo hee heere addeth and expreſſeth the cauſe, which moued God to bind himſelf ſo vnto vs: to wit, <hi>his meere mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:7694:52"/>
            <p>By this we are admoniſhed, that when we are to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, we ſhould alwayes haue regarde vnto theſe twoo things: to wit, the grace of God and his free mercie, and after that his promiſe. God is good and liberall, and ſee why it is, that he with pitie looketh vppon vs: and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs with his eyes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion, vouchſafeth to receiue vs, yea and calleth and allureth vs vnto him, and alſo imboldeneth vs to craue of him, to the end he would help and ſuccour vs in all our needes and neceſſities. Now this goodneſſe ſhould lye hidden in God, were it not that hee made vs to feele it by his promiſe: For God ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto vs, to be ſuch a one as in deede he is, he layeth his heart wide open, when he rendreth vs a teſtimonie of the loue hee beareth vs.</p>
            <p>Loe heere why I haue ſaid, that in all our prayers wee ought to haue theſe two conſiderations: The one is, that God is ſo good and louing, that although wee bee poore and miſerable creatures, and nothing elſe but doung and ſtench, yet for all that hee ceaſeth not too loue vs, and to haue greate care of our ſaluation. And ſince wee are come too the promiſe, which is a ſure teſtimonie that God is ſuch one we ſhould no more doubt what affection he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, whether he be our friend or enemie, ſeeing it is ſo that he is very well willing to bee bounde vnto vs, in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto vs that he is our father, and taketh vs to bee his Children.</p>
            <p>Nowe Dauid maketh ſuch a requeſt as we haue already touched, to the end he might anſwere thoſe which wrought him ſhame. Although he ſayth word for word, <hi>To the ende I may anſweare theſe which woorke me ſhame.</hi> Heere Dauid declareth, that when God ſhall haue ayded him, that then he ſhall be able to withſtand all his enemyes, put by all the iniuries &amp; ſcornes of the vnbelieuers and faythleſſe which they did lay before him, to the end too ſhake and cruſh the faythful and to deſtroy them, yea and vtterly to make their fayth nothing woorth, if it were posſible for them to do it. By this we are let to vnderſtande, that if we make our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb facs="tcp:7694:53"/>to God, whenſoeuer it ſhal happen al the world too aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile vs, and that it might ſeeme wee ſhoulde be plunged in hel an hundred thouſand tymes, yet wee might ſtande ſure againſt al our enemies: yea verely, for God wil neuer fayle vs, whenſoeuer we ſhall deſire &amp; pray him to performe his promiſes vnto vs, and make vs feele his goodneſſe for our ſaluation. Moreouer if we haue wherewithal too reſiſte the wicked and vngodly which come vppon vs too daunt and quaile our fayth, we ſhall haue alſo wherwith to withſtande Satan. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men ſhal perſecute vs, or deride the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, and labour al they may to turne vs away from them, it commeth not of themſelues, but it is the Deuill which puſheth them foreward. Euen ſo then, wee may fight and winne the victorie againſt al the combats of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if we wil pray vnto God, after the example of Dauid.</p>
            <p>This is alſo to be conſidered and noted which heere hee addeth, when he ſayeth, <hi>My delight is in thy woorde.</hi> Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth what ſignes and tokens he deſired of God here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he would doo vnto him as he had promiſed. For I haue delight therein, ſaith hee, would wee then haue God his promiſes to take place in vs, to open the gate that wee might come vntoo him, that they might bee as keyes too giue vs in entree, too the ende our requeſtes and petitions might bee receiued? wee muſt then ioyne hope therewith. And loe what is the cauſe why wee feele not the power of the promiſes of God as wee ought: the reaſon is, for that we haue no hope nor truſt in them. It is moſt true, that god for his parte is alwaies true of his woord: and although we are miſerable faythleſſe people, yet wil hee neuer falſify his fayth which he hath giuen to vs. But what? Surely wee are vnwoorthy ones too feele ſuch a pleaſure. In very deed, god hath promiſed to powre his grace vpon vs, as alſo hee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it vntoo vs: But yet are wee vtterly vnworthy thereof, without we belieue his promiſes, would we that god ſhold do vnto vs according to his word? we muſt then receiue his word, and imbrace it by fayth:<note place="margin">Heb. 4.<hi>2.</hi>
               </note>as alſo the Apoſtle treateth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7694:53"/>thereof. And thus much as touching theſe two firſt verſes.</p>
            <p>Nowe it followeth: <hi>Take not the woorde of thy trueth vtterly out of my mouth: for I waite for thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Dauid ſayth, <hi>O take not the woord of thy trueth out of my mouth:</hi> He meaneth not, that it ſufficeth too magnifie God with his toung: and to make many goodly proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before the worlde: but he preſuppoſeth, that when he hath witneſſed of the trueth of God with his mouth, that it muſt alſo be graffed within his hearte. And in deede, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſpeaketh not heere like an hypocrite, as they do which would ſeeme to make a goodly ſhew before him: and think them ſelues wel inough and in good caſe, when as they are openly ſuppoſed too bee very faithful, well thought off, and taken to be very honeſt men, this think they is all that is to be required. But Dauid hath not proceeded after this manner: For when he ſayth, <hi>Take not the word of thy trueth out of my month, O Lord:</hi> It is aſmuch as if hee had fayde, O Lorde, doe me not onely this grace, that I truſt ſecretly in thee, that I ſtay me vpon thy promiſes, that I ſtand ſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the aſſaultes of mine enemyes, but namely and chiefely euen before the face of men: that my faith might declare it ſelfe, that by this meane I might guide and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct all thoſe which would come unto thee: &amp; contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that I might withſtand all thoſe which ſhall goe about to ouerthrowe this ſpirituall hope of mine, which I have in thee and in thy trueth. And when thou O Lorde ſhalte haue deepely rooted thy worde in mine hearte, let it alſo bee often times in my mouthe, that I may magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy name before men.</p>
            <p>Wee haue to learne out of this place, that in the firſt place we muſt be aſſured of the trueth of God, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that men perceiue it not vs: And againe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though euery man would keepe it ſo ſecrete too him ſelfe, as that no man in all the worlde knewe thereof, yet GOD and his Angels doe knowe, how true and certaine
<pb facs="tcp:7694:54"/>we eſteeme it to be, and alſo how we yeelde therto, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which vnto it appertaineth, and to be ſuch in deede as deſerueth to bee holden for true and faithful. And thus much for the firſt poynt. Now for the ſeconde, Let vs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly conſider to edifie our neighbours, that they might be confirmed by our example, and all with one accorde to truſt in God, that the wicked and vngodly might bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that we might vexe them, that we haue wherin to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, notwithſtanding all their windelaſſes, priuy deuiſes, and whatſoeuer miſchiefe elſe they are any way able to imagine againſt vs, and thinking to make vs as prophane as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet that we may be able to caſt them of, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Dauid, Lo then, the worde which he deſireth to haue alwayes in his mouth, too confirme all thoſe which would truſt in God, and to confound all them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride and ſcorne his worde and trueth. But what meaneth he by this ſaying, <hi>For euer?</hi> That is, that he beeing as it were forſaken of God in all his afflictions, was as one that were dumbe and coulde not ſpeake, as he complayneth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. And in deede, ſo long as God ſheweth vnto vs no token of his grace, although our enemyes deride vs with open mouth, yet we are not at that libertie to confute them and ſtop their mouthes. Dauid then beeing thus tempted a long time, deſireth that the confeſſion wherewith hee might be able to magnifie God, might not to be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for euer. Wherein we are to obſerue, that if God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leaueth vs confounded after the maner of the world, in ſteade of beeing diſmayed, wee ought too beſeech him that hee woulde not ſuffer our mouthes too be ſtopped for euer.</p>
            <p>Nowe he repeateth it ouer againe: <hi>For my hope is in thy iudgementes.</hi> It is not without cauſe that Dauid ſtil maketh this proteſtation: For as I haue already ſaide, behold what power and efficacy the woorde of God cauſeth vs to feele (according to that place which I haue alledged out of the Epiſtle too the Hebrues) when wee haue therewith hope alſo, which hangeth vpon faith. It is true that God ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7694:54"/>out his hand vnto his people, when he brought them out of the land of Aegypt, to the ende hee woulde bringe them into the promiſed land. But what? the people ſtayed not them ſelues vpon God, and therefore it was meete that that promiſe ſhould be voyde, yea and that iuſtly vnto ſuch a faythleſſe people. God had no long time to finde out ſuch a woonderfull &amp; meruaylous ſtraunge meane as that man could not poſſibly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue, how that might be brought to paſſe which hee had ſpoken. But this auayled them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which were faithleſſe: For loe they beeing excluded from ſuch a benefite: are depriued of that promiſed inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce. Let vs then learne, that when wee woulde haue God to open his hand vnto vs and deale liberally with vs, to haue vs to feele his mightie power, and that wee might perceiue the fruite and benefite of his promiſes. It is meete that we plant them deepely in our heartes: that wee may ſay after the example of Dauid, <hi>My hope O Lorde is in thy iudgementes.</hi> For this woorde <hi>Integritie</hi> or <hi>iudgement,</hi> wee haue heere before already declared, ſignifieth nothing elſe but the doctrine conteined in the law of God, yea although he heere vſeth diuerſe and ſundry woordes, yet doe they tende alwayes to one and the ſelfe ſame ende. Loe then whether we muſt refer the iudgements of God: to wit, that that which we reade in the word of God and that which is preached vnto vs out of the ſame, we muſt vnderſtand and knowe to bee ſure and certaine Statutes and ordinaunces, and ſo well ordered as that they cannot bee bettered, and therfore to haue all our hope and truſt in them. Now he goeth on and ſayth,</p>
            <q>
               <l>So ſhall I alway keepe thy lawe: yea for euer and euer.</l>
               <l>And I will walke at libertie: for I ſeeke thy commandements.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Dauid heere maketh proteſtation not onely of his good affection &amp; integritie, but alſo ſheweth the fruite and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that might come vnto him, when as God ſhall have ſo holpen him and that he ſhall haue put in proofe the fruit of his faith. Loe then how this place muſt be expounded: O Lord, when I ſhall once haue knowen thee to be my ſauiour
<pb facs="tcp:7694:55"/>and felt by proofe thy mercie: then will I keepe thy lawe a greate deale better: As if he ſhould haue ſaid, I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually confirmed in thy obedience: and that ſhall greatly helpe me, to make alwayes forward. And to ſay the trueth, all the graces which we receiue from God, ſhould conduct and leade vs a great deale further, that if wee haue already beene in a good way and forwardneſſe, it is to this end that wee ſhoulde continue in it, and goe on more and more, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as we come to the end.</p>
            <p>It is very true that God in conducting vs, looketh not for any recompence. For he will lightly paſſe it ouer: but this is ſpoken for our vſe and inſtruction. And when we pray vnto God, we ought to ſeeke after all the thinges that can be which might confirme vs, that we ſhould not doubt but that God would heare our requeſts, and that we ſhould alſo vnderſtand and knowe to what ende wee ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thoſe benefites which he beſtoweth vpon vs, and that we receiue at his hands. Now then, when Dauid ſaith, <hi>I ſhall alwayes keepe thy lawe: yea for euer and euer.</hi> By this wee haue to note, that accordingly as God liberally beſtoweth his benefits vpon vs, that our faith ſhould be ſo much the more ſtrengthened in him, that we ought the rather too be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a true deſire &amp; zeale, to yeelde our ſelues fully and wholly too him, to cleaue to his righteouſneſſe, and to keepe his lawe and woorde. And I woulde it pleaſed God that this might bee deepely imprinted in our minde. But what? we ſee the vnthankfulneſſe, which is as it were in vs all. For God neuer ceaſeth to doe vs good, and will dayly giue vs newe matter to truſt in him, to loue and ſerue him. But whatſoeuer he doth for vs, it auaileth vs nothing, for we are alwayes colde as yſe: there is no zeale in vs, no not ſo much as any motion, ſo that it ſeemeth wee are altogither ſenſeleſſe. And the rather ought we to meditate vpon this Doctrine: For it is the right remedy to amend our ſo great litherneſſe and coldeneſſe.</p>
            <p>Let vs then learne, that when Dauid ſayth, <hi>I ſhall keepe thy Law, O Lorde,</hi> that by this he meaneth, that according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7694:55"/>as God putteth vnto vs his helping hande, and that wee haue had proofe of his graces, that we receiue the fruite &amp; commoditie thereof, which we haue hoped for in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: that it ought to ſerue vs for a more ample and large confirmation, and that we ought a greate deale rather too be ſtirred vp to loue God, and to ſerue him, and too yeelde vs vnto his worde, in ſumme as heere it is ſaide, too keepe his lawe. But yet there is a great deale more to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For Dauid ſpeaketh not heere of a blaſt of winde, as ſome ſhall be very forwarde for a little time: But hee ſayeth, <hi>I will alwayes keepe thy lawe: yea, for euer and euer.</hi> Wherein he ſheweth, that we ought to haue ſuch a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of the benefites of God, that it neuer ſlip from vs. For as I haue heereof already ſpoken, wee ſhall ſee ſome in this behalfe, which ſhall be moued for a little while, when as God ſhall haue deliuered them from any daunger, and hath beſtowed vppon them ſome fauour and grace: they ſhall haue a very good taſte and feeling, and ſay, Alas, howe greately am I bounden and beholden to my God? Loe a man woulde thinke that theſe men were well affected. But in the turning of a hand, no doubte it is ſoone forgotten: or at the leaſt if they remember it a little while, they waxe colde againe and thinke no more of it. Since then it is ſo, let vs mark, according to that which is ſpoken in this place, that it is not meete that the remembrance of God his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites ſhould at any time be wiped out of our heartes: but let vs beſeech him to make vs to keepe his lawe for euer and euer: and in ſuch ſort to inſtruct vs, as that wee deſire none other thing of him, but to ſtick vnto his maieſtie, and to his righteouſneſſe. It followeth:</p>
            <q>That hee will walke at libertie: becauſe hee ſeeketh his Commaundementes.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>To walke at liberty,</hi> ſignifieth to go at a mans owne wil &amp; pleaſure: For like as when we are in a narrowe &amp; ſtraight rowme, we know not which way to turne vs, but think our ſelues cleane pend vp: Euen ſo alſo are wee ouer narrowly held in, or elſe ſurely we look about vs to ſee if we can finde
<pb facs="tcp:7694:56"/>which way to get out, and ſo doe remaine in perplexitie or doubte. And is this the aſſuraunce and ioy that wee muſt haue in the lawe of God. What? is this it? Dauid contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe ſayth, <hi>That he will walke at libertie:</hi> to wit, that hee will boldely walke the brode beaten way, as we ſay, after he hath ſought the Commaundementes of God. This is alſo a thing which we ought wel to obſerue and keepe. For the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of Dauid meaneth rightly to ſhewe vs, that when we are deſirous to haue our life ruled by the commaundementes of God, to ſuffer him too bee our leader and guide, and giue vnto him the conducte of all our affayres and buſineſſes, that hee will ſo frame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto vs, ſo farre foorth as hee ſhall knowe to bee good and expedient for our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>And this benefite which wee receiue by the knowledge heereof is ineſtimable: to wit, that we may walke at liberty, That is to ſay, that wee are deliuered from many doubtes and griefes: that we cannot bee vtterly ouerthrowne and caſte downe, although we happen to be preſſed with ſome griefes: becauſe we alwayes conclude thus, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ouercome, ſeeing God holdeth vs with a mightie and ſtronge hande. And in very deede what is the cauſe, I pray you, that men are ſo oftentimes tormented, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they ſubmit not them ſelues vnto God? It is very true, that there are very fewe which knowe this, but this is the very cauſe: For when as wee ſhall haue looked ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what neerer the matter, wee ſhall find that nothing ſo much hath hindred vs, as our owne vnthankfulneſſ: But becauſe we wil be ouerwiſe, in not yeelding vnto God the honor to gouerne vs, &amp; wholy to rule our life, ne yet become his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, it is meet we ſhould receiue the hier due for the ſame. For men whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing is in queſtion that they haue to do, wil ſtraight wayes enter into their owne ſpeculations, they neuer make queſtion to haue recourſe vnto God, nor to cal vpon him, but euery man wil doe what ſemeth beſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And therfore it is meete that God pay vs in ſuch mony as we deſerued, that he put vs, I ſay, in ſuch doubt as that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7694:56"/>wee ſhall neuer be able to knowe what ſhall become of vs, ſo that the anguiſhes ſhall force vs too ſay, What ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this matters? Which way ſhall I beginne? And what ſhall bee the ende and iſſue heereof?</p>
            <p>Beholde howe wee ſee the miſerable and wretched worlde, dayly ſo faſt ſhutte vp in ſtreights, as that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeth that wee are more then caſt away. And what is the cauſe heereof? Euen the men which haue built vnto them ſelues ſuch Mazes. For it is euen they them ſelues that are the cauſe of their ſo greate tormentes. For Dauid hath heere declared vnto vs, that as many as ſeeke the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God, doe walke at libertie. It is very true, that the faithfull although they indeuour themſelues all they can, to obey God, and ſuffer him to gouerne them, yet for all that they are not voyde of merueylous griefes &amp; vexations that they are many tymes at their wittes end and knowe not what to doe, but yet they come vnto God, and lay all their care vpon him, as it is written in the thirtie and ſeuenth Pſalme. And there they finde them ſelues diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and vnburdened. And ſo goe they dayly on: for they are aſſured that God can neuer fayle them. Beholde then, howe we may bee very well tempted with many ſorrowes and griefes, neither can wee be exempt from a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of diſquietneſſes: but yet God will alwayes vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vs of them, as it is ſayd in an other place of the Pſalme, that when we haue beene for a while faſt ſhut vpp, yet God will ſet vs at libertie: as alſo Saint Paul ſayth in the ſecond to the Corinthes: <hi>It is very true,</hi> ſayth hee, <hi>that wee are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with many tormentes and griefes, but yet we continue not in ſorrowe and payne: For God will alwayes deliuer vs, and will giue vs a good and ioyfull iſſue, ſo that in the ende, wee ſhall bee able to ouercome them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See then what is declared vnto vs in this place, where it is ſayde, <hi>I will walke at libertie, O Lorde, becauſe I ſeeke thy Commaundementes.</hi> Euen ſo let vs knowe, that when our life is miſerable and wretched, and that we muſt needes
<pb facs="tcp:7694:57"/>liue in payne, torment, and ſorrowe: that all commeth by reaſon of our ſinne, becauſe wee preſent not our ſelues before GOD, ſuffer vs not to be conducted by him, put not our liues into his handes, neither doo wee come wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly too ſeeke for remedie, after wee haue once knowen out griefe: that is too ſay, too deſire God that it woulde pleaſe him to take vs into his cuſtodye, without hoping or wayting for any other thing, but for that which he telleth vs out of his woorde. For when wee ſhall ſo doo, there is no doubte, but that he will make vs too walke at libertie. Nowe it followeth:</p>
            <q>I will ſpeak of thy Teſtimonyes alſo euen before Kinges: and will not be aſhamed.</q>
            <p>Beholde a declaration of the matter which wee haue already touched heere before: For Dauid making this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, not to haue the woorde of trueth to bee taken out of his mouth for euer, had regarde to twoo thinges: that is to ſay, beeing able too ſpeake, after that GOD in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing his grace vpon him, had opened his mouth, had confirmed the Children of GOD by his example, and brought them vnto him in ſhewing them the way, and in the meane whyle had foyled the wicked and deſpiſers of God and of the Lawe, the ſcorners of his hope, and the blaſphemers of God: yet was hee able, I ſay, too beate them backe, and make his parte good againſte them all. And this matter hee manifeſtly declareth, whereas hee ſayeth, <hi>I will ſpeake of thy Teſtimonyes,</hi> becauſe GOD ſhoulde no more take the woorde of trueth out of his mouth.</p>
            <p>Nowe beſides this, that God giueth vntoo vs matter whereof to ſpeake freely, yet muſt that come from him, as we heare, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſte hath ſpoken off: that it is the holy Ghoſte which guideth our tongues, that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not of ourſelues, to be able to anſwere our enemies that there neded but a ſmall gale of wind to ouerthrow vs. So then, it is meete that God ſhoulde vſe his power that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7694:57"/>we might be confirmed by him: For when as he ſhal put his woorde in our mouth, we may ſpeake before Kinges and Princes, and neuer be aſhamed. As if he ſhould haue ſayde, O Lorde, thy woorde ought to be of ſuch power vnto vs, as that wee may foyle our enenemyes, yea howe greate and mightie ſoeuer they bee: albeit they ſhould bee ſuche as were able to aſtoniſh and feare all the whole world, yet let our Fayth be ouerthrowne, through their mightineſſe, and pompe: knowing that when as they ſhall thinke too ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe all vp, yet that we be left ſtil alwayes as Conquerors, yea euen becauſe we haue regarde to it.</p>
            <p>Nowe heere wee are too note, that when God maketh his trueth forcible in vs, it ſhall bee ſufficient too holde vs vpp, yea, notwithſtanding all the Combates that the Deuill ſhall ſtirre vpp agaynſt vs, and that the whole world oppoſed it ſelfe too the contrary. And it is not without cauſe that this is ſpoken, for whereon is our fayth ſetled? Euen vppon the trueth of God. Let vs nowe compare God with men, and with all their woorkes and vertues. Let vs take Emperours and Kinges: and let all their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and pompe bee ſet foorth too the ſhewe, and let God be ſet right ouer agaynſt them: too witte, whether men with all their mightineſſe and great boaſting, are able too ſurmounte God, too reuerſe his will, or too make voyde his power and vertue? Oh, it is very ſure they can neuer be able to doe it.</p>
            <p>So then, let vs conſider with whome wee haue too deale, and remember this ſaying of Saincte Paule, <hi>Thou knoweſt</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>to what ende thy beliefe ſerueth.</hi> When then wee ſhall haue our eyes ſo fixed vppon GOD, who hath armed vs with his infallible trueth, wee may bee able too withſtande and fall out with all whatſoeuer that lifteth it ſelfe vpp too the contrary: Wee ſhall haue no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion too feare the worlde, for GOD is ſufficiently able too ouercome all the ſcruples and griefes which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſhall rayſe vppe agaynſte vs. And thus muche as
<pb facs="tcp:7694:58"/>concerning this poynte.</p>
            <p>Moreouer we ſee that when there is any queſtion to make confeſſion of our faith, it cannot be that men ſhalbe able to abaſh and feare vs with al their power and might: As at this day we ſee, when as they woulde gladly make vs too trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. What I beſeech you Sir? (wil they ſay) you are but euen a handfull of people. Doe you thinke your ſelues wiſer then all the Kings and Princes of the world? You ſee that all the world, are againſt this doctrine which you holde &amp; profeſſe: and what doe you thinke to doe? True in deede, that at the firſte ſight, this were euen inough too ſhake vs, yea were it not that we knewe, and were very certaine: but when we looke vnto God, then all this geere vaniſheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too ſmoke: theſe are but Bladders pufte full of winde: and the leaſte pinnes poynte, will emptie them. In ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deede theſe will bee greate fraybugges, but yet it will all prooue nothing. Beholde theſe Frogges, beholde theſe Piſmeres, yea, beholde theſe Flyes and Gnattes, for they are all no better then very vermine and wormes, when as they ſhall lifte them ſelues vp thus againſt God.</p>
            <p>So then let vs learne, yea let vs learne to ſtay our ſelues ſo vpon God, as that when we ſhall be called too make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith, ſince it is ſo that it is GOD whiche hath ſpoken, let all the creatures in the worlde be nothing to vs warde: let vs not bee aſhamed, and let nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſtoppe vs, from mainteining of his woorde. In the ende Dauid concludeth and ſayth,</p>
            <q>My handes alſo will I lifte vpp vnto thy Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, which I haue loued: and my ſtudy ſhallbee in thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>Theſe twoo verſes heere neede no long declaration, for wee haue already had the ſame ſentences: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge Dauid ſheweth vs, that it is not inough to thinke of this Doctrine for a time: but wee muſte all the courſe of our life profite our ſelues therein more and more.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7694:58"/>Loe here the principall point which we haue to note, that we muſt take pleaſure in the commaundementes of God which we haue loued: to wit, that wee ought to learne to conceiue ſuch an affection and deſire to followe the worde of God, and to ſticke thereto, as that we ſhould be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to ſay, In very deede, this is the moſt ſweete and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable thing that poſsibly can be, to ſubiect our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of our God and to beare it and therefore wee muſt drawe in it, and obey him. Haue we done this? Wee muſt then in ſteade of a number of fooliſh vanities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we are enclined, yea, and in place of the wicked affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and allurementes of Satan, learne to take pleaſure in the worde of God, ſo that we may proteſt in trueth (after the example of Dauid) that they are the commandements of God which we haue loued. Moreouer let vs marke well this ſentence, when he ſaith, <hi>My handes alſo wil I lift vp vnto thy commaundementes.</hi> For this is as much as if he had ſaid, O Lord, I will not onely proteſt with my mouth that I loue thy word, but I will alſo lift vp my hands: yea, as wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, I will lift vp my handes to the caky God. By this he letteth vs to vnderſtande, that if we would ſerue God as becommeth vs, that it is not enough for vs to witneſſe the truthe of God with our mouth, but we muſt alſo ſhewe by our good and godly life, that which wee proteſt with our mouth, and that there be an accorde and ſweete harmonie betweene the one and the other. True it is, wee ſhall finde ſome doubtes when as there ſhalbe any queſtion of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing God: but this ſentence is to bee noted, when hee ſayeth, I will lift vp my hands. And to know that when God ſhall ſee, that it ſhall ſurpaſſe our force and ſtrength, let vs pray vnto him to graunt vs that grace, that we may lift vp our handes vnto his commaundementes, to witte, ſo high as we can poſsibly, to the ende wee may take holde of his grace and vertue, better then heretofore we haue done. Lo in what maner we ought to doe in this caſe, that not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of our owne power and ſtrength, we might praye notwithſtanding this good God, to make his grace ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
<pb facs="tcp:7694:59"/>in vs, as that it may ſettle and reigne there, and to haue vs know that it is not in vaine that hee calleth vs vnto him &amp; giueth vs his truthe. Which thing no doubt he will doe ſo that wee reiect not his grace, which hee ſo freely offereth vnto vs. And according to this holy doctrine let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging our faultes, beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him to open our eyes, to the ende wee may know our wretchednes, &amp; the miſerable conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherein we ſtande, that wee might returne to him: yea, and that with a certaine confidence, that hee will perfourme that which he hath promiſed vs: that we be not fruſtrate of our hope, when as it ſhall ſtay vpon him, and in his truthe, but that hee will more and more ſtrengthen vs therein, vntill ſuch time as we come to the perfect knowledge of thinges, which we yet knowe not but in parte. That not only he will grant vs this grace, but alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all people and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Auid here, maketh a requeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, which wee are all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make: but not with ſuch affection as hee deeth. For wee can not proteſt, after his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that all our ioye, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of our aduerſities, is in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating and ſtudying of that which God hath ſhewed vnto vs by his woorde. And that it is ſo, we ſee that whenſoeuer any of vs ſhall endure and abide
<pb facs="tcp:7694:60"/>any grief, whether runne wee then for refuge and ayde? Forſooth euery of vs faineth him ſelfe a comfort, as beſt pleaſeth him. For very fewe of vs reſt vppon God and truſt in him, ne yet leane vpon his promiſes: yea, we ſhall finde none almoſt which doth it. And ſee why wee can not craue of God, as Dauid doth, <hi>Which remembreth him of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that he hath made vs.</hi> And therefore it can not be that this was ſet downe in vaine. Let vs therefore note, that God ſheweth vnto vs, from whence wee muſt receiue our comfort and conſolation in all our afflictions: to wit, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath bound him ſelfe vnto vs, and that hee hath witneſſed vnto vs, that he will haue pitie and compaſsion vpon thoſe which will call vpon him in their miſeries, and holding vs to that, we ſhould be as it were quickened: that is to ſay, that although we were oppreſſed with afflictions euen to the vttermoſt, ſo that wee were as it were almoſt dead, that this onely point might ſuffice vs: certainely to knowe that God will not forſake vs. And for doing hereof, we are to obſerue twoo pointes: The firſt is, that we reſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon our ſelues ne yet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> creatures, ſetting our hope too fondly here and there: but let vs know, that our life and all our felicitie conſiſteth in God, and that there it is which we muſt ſeeke after. Loe then the ende, whereat we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, if we will haue true comfort in our aduerſities. And contrariwyſe, we ſee how our mindes wander &amp; go aſtraye, and that is, bicauſe euery of vs faineth vnto him ſelfe fooliſh and vnprofitable confidences: for if we knew the thing that is in God, it ſhould make vs neuer to turne away from him, we ſhould neuer more wander after creatures, for in them is nothing els but vanitie. And therefore we ought to haue the greater regarde vnto this doctrine: to wit, that if we wil be deliuered from all euill, wee muſt ſtill looke vnto God. The ſecond is, that we are to craue of God, that hee would haue pitie and compaſsion vpon vs, and deliuer vs from all our afflictions:yea and that we may come vnto him by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his promiſſe. For without God call vs vnto him, wee can not come vnto him but vnaduiſedly. For it ſhould bee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7694:60"/>too too great preſumption for mortall men to take vppon them ſuch boldnes, as to come vnto God, without he gaue them leaue, and exhorted them ſo to doe. Wee muſt then haue the word which God giueth vs, by which he teſtifieth vnto vs, that he is ready to receiue vs, and willeth vs alſo to come vnto him. Loe what this verſe emporteth, when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſayeth, that the comfort which hee receiued in all his aduerſities, was, that hee was quickened by the woorde of God. By this he ſheweth, that hee not onely wayted vppon God, to be ſaued by him but that he had reſpect, namely to his promiſe: for without it (as I haue already ſaid) we can haue no acceſſe vnto God.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, wee are to note, that this woorde, <hi>to quicken,</hi> importeth a great matter: to wit, that the word of God ſhould haue this power &amp; ſtrength, that if wee ſhould be as it were forlorne and deſperate, that it would comfort and reſtore vs, and that wee ſhould receiue life through it. In very deede, this is a hard matter to put in practiſe: but we muſt not thinke that Dauid hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing here, but euen as in deede it was. For in making of ſuch a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, his meaning is to inſtruct vs after his example, what our duetie is. And that which is more, the holy Ghoſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth here to ſhewe vs, that the word of God hath not taken deepe roote in vs, except it quicken vs: to wit, that it pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs as it were out of the graue, when we are caſt downe and that wee can doe no more, giuing vs freſhe force and ſtrength, to be as it were men brought backe out of hell, as if he tooke vs by the hand lifting vs vp into a luſty courage. And thus much for this verſe.</p>
            <p>Now here aboue, Dauid maketh his requeſt, <hi>That God would be mindefull of his word, which he had giuen him: wherein</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou haſt cauſed mee to put my truſt.</hi> Here Dauid ſheweth vs, that when the faithfull doe glad and comfort them ſelues with the promiſes of God, and be as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, it is not done to the ende that wee ſhoulde become cold and blockiſh: but that we ought rather to be ſtirred vp the more to pray vnto God. Whenſoeuer then wee ſhalbe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:61"/>oppreſſed with any aduerſitie, loe what the remedie is that we muſt take: to looke vnto the promiſes of God, and to thinke of that which hee hath teſtified vnto vs of his owne good will. Herevpon let vs boldly confirme our ſelues, and returne as it were to life, if that we haue beene in death. But after that we haue made the promiſes of God ſo forcible, as to take courage, and to be fortified therein, wee muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes fall to our prayers and offer them to God, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him to perfourme his woord. And ſince it is ſo, that he is faithfull, let vs be ſure that we ſhall not go away emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if we beleeue his word: but that he will performe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he hath promiſed. See then, that after we haue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated of the promiſes of God, and truſted to him, let vs make our prayers many times and runne vnto his maieſtie for ayde, beſeeching him to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhe that, which through his infinite goodnes he hath ſhewed vnto vs, and neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake vs. but too declare the ſame too bee ſo in effect and deede. This is it that Dauid here meaneth by this ſentence. <hi>Be mindefull, O Lorde, of thy word and promiſe.</hi> Dauid ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here according to the groſſenes and weakeneſſe of mans vnderſtanding. For it is moſt certaine, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forgetteth that which he hath ſaid, ſo that he needeth to be ſolicited, to be put in minde of it as mortall men are, which promiſe much at randon, and neuer remember it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now we muſt not imagine God to be ſuch one, but ſuffereth vs to ſtammer after our owne faſhion, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the accompliſhment of his promiſes, ſo that wee knowe not who is the cauſe of the let: God, I ſay, then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth vs to ſpeake after our owne guiſe, and ſaye, <hi>be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, O Lord,</hi> that is, we beſeech thee to ſhewe vnto vs by the effect, that thou haſt not forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the promiſes which thou haſt made to vs Thou O Lord, art not like men, who after they haue determined vpon any matter, neuer thinke after of that which they haue ſaid. Wherefore, O Lord, ſhew not thy ſelfe to be like mortall men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the worde, let it be done, and forthwith executed.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:7694:61"/>
            <p>See then howe wee muſt proceede, that after we haue once knowne to ſtaye our ſelues vppon the promiſes of God, we muſt beſeeche him to ſhew vnto vs by proufe, that ſo many as put their truſt in him, ſhall not be deceiued. Nowe hee ſayeth, <hi>Thy worde towardes thy ſeruant.</hi> And this ſentence is worthy to be well wayed, bicauſe that there are very fewe, when any mention is made of the woorde of God, which vnderſtand and knowe that it is ſpoken to them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they knowe that, all is to no purpoſe. Wee may reade the Bible an hundreth times ouer, but wee ſhall neuer haue any taſte of the promiſes of God, or certainly if we learne any thing out of it, that ſhall no whit aſſure vs, to conceiue a true certaintie of our ſaluation except we knowe that it is to vs which God ſpeaketh, that it is wee euen wee, I ſaye, whome hee woulde make to feele his mercy and fatherly loue. If we conceiue of the promiſes of God as hanging in the ayre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God hath ſpoken, &amp; we know not to whom, to what purpoſe ſhall this bee? What benefite ſhall wee reape by this? So then, let vs throughly conſider of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Be mindful, O Lord, of thy ſeruant according to thy word.</hi> Dauid applieth vnto him ſelfe the promiſes which he had receiued, for he knew that they appertayned vnto hym, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doubted not that he was the childe of God: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued them with ſuch a faith, hee ſayeth, O Lorde. Thou haſt not ſpoken to this body or to that body, as though I knewe not to whome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I am out of all doubt, that thou meaneſt to call me vnto thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and haſt declared vnto me that I ſhalbe partaker of all the benefites which thou haſt promiſed vnto the faithfull. Loe then, after what maner we muſt do herein.</p>

Then may we boldly call vpon him, and euen ſay, although
<pb facs="tcp:7694:62"/>I am a miſerable and forlorne creature, ſince it is ſaide that God is mercifull to thoſe which haue offended him: I will runne vnto him and to his mercy, beſeeching him that hee will make me to feele it. And ſince it is ſaide. <hi>That God ſo loued the world;</hi>

               <hi>that he ſpared not his onely begotten ſonne: but deliuered him to death for vs.</hi> It is meete I looke to that. For it is very needefull, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould plucke mee out from that condemnation, wherein I am. Since it is ſo, that the loue and goodneſſe of God is declared vnto the worlde, in that that his ſonne Chriſte Ieſus hath ſuffered death, I muſt appropriate the ſame to my ſelfe, that I may knowe that it is to me, that God hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he would I ſhould take the poſſeſsion of ſuch a grace, and therein to reioyce me.</p>
            <p>We ſee now, how we muſt practiſe this ſentence, that we may ſay vnto God, <hi>Thinke vpon thy ſeruant, O Lorde, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy word.</hi> If any man wil reply, that it can not be ſaid, that God hath ſpoken to him, when as he ſpeaketh to al in generall: let vs conſider, that God offereth his grace too men in common, to the ende that euery man might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enter into him ſelfe, and not to doubt being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the church, but that hee hath a part and portion of that, which is common to all the faithfull.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9.</note> all the faithfull in generall ought to receiue this promiſe, &amp; that al alſo, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the greateſt to the leaſt, might knowe that God offereth him ſelfe vnto them, and allureth them, to the ende that this promiſe might be performed and perfited vnto them. And ſee why the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not adminiſtred vnto vs in common: but to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſeuerally. We will neuer baptize the whole Churche with one baptiſme: but euery one wilbe baptized in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. And what other thing is meant by baptiſme, but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of al the promiſes of God, which he hath giuen in common to the whole body of his churche. See then, howe the promiſes are ſpeciall in the vertue of baptiſme. And ſo is it in the Supper. For when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7694:62"/>we come to receiue the bread and wine in the Supper, our Lord Ieſus declareth vnto vs, that as hee once for all ſhed his moſt precious blood for our redemption, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that his body alſo is our meat and nurriture. Lo then, howe wee ought to be fully aſſured, that it is to vs which God ſpeaketh, and that he alſo offereth his mercie to vs in common. And ſee why Dauid alſo addeth, and ſayeth,</p>
            <q>The ſame is my comfort in my trouble: for thy worde hath quickened me.</q>
            <p>For this is the right and true vſe whereunto wee ought to applie the promiſes of God: to wit, that where it might ſeeme that wee were diſcomforted and caſt away, yet ſhould wee not but haue a firme courage, and an inuincible conſtancie For els we ſhould greatly diſhonour God, ſince he hath tolde vs, that we ſhould not diſpaire, but that hee would be our ſauiour vnto the ende. Whereupon we muſt conclude, that ſo often as wee conceiue any diſtruſt in our aduerſities, ſo often do we blaſpheme his maieſtie. For we can not do greater iniurie and deſpite vnto God, then to accuſe him to be a lyer, &amp; thinke him to be diſloyal or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull. Now if we thinke God to bee true and faithfull, we muſt holde it for a full concluſion, that hee will neuer ſuffer vs to be fruſtrate, ſo long as we put our truſt in him. Now by this meane we ſhall liue euen in death.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore throughly conſider of this ſentence which Dauid hath here couched, that God hauing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be his ſauiour, hath quickened him in this, yea in the middeſt of his afflictions, as if he had ſaide, O Lorde, ſince it is ſo, that I haue a teſtimonie of thy good will and loue, I ought not to be diſcouraged, nor faint hearted, for whatſoeuer may come to paſſe. Now it followeth,</p>
            <q>The wicked, or proud haue had me exceedingly in deriſion: yet haue I not declined from thy lawe.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid ſheweth his conſtancie in reſiſting the temptations and combattes wherewith Satan aſſayled him. For beholde howe our faith ſhalbe rightly and duely
<pb facs="tcp:7694:63"/>approued: to wit, when as we ſbalbe aſſailed, and when as the deuill ſhall thinke that he hath gotten the better of vs, yet muſt wee perſeuer and ſtill continue to truſt in God: lo, I ſay, a good proufe of our faith. And this is it that Dauid meaneth to ſignifie in this place: for it is an eaſie matter, when as we ſhall haue no temptations to trouble vs, to take a taſt of the promiſes of GOD, and to hope that hee will doe that which he hath ſpoken. But when as we ſhalbe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with afflictions, then the deuill commeth and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs in minde of many irkſomeneſſes, and fantaſies, as if God were retired and gone farre from vs, and that the wicked and vngodly make a mocke at our ſimplicitie: when I ſaye, that wee are ſo aſſayled: then muſt our faith ſhewe it ſelfe, whether it be true or not. And if then wee ſhall conſtantly perſeuer without beeing vanquiſhed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, O ſee nowe a ſure and certaine ſigne that wee haue beleeued in good earneſt and not hypocritically, that wee haue not taken his worde in vayne, but it hath beene liuely rooted in our ſoules. Let vs then well note, that if wee will haue a true proufe of our faith, and learne too ſpeake in truth that we haue truſted in God, and his promiſes: it is meete that wee ſhould feele very boyſterous aſſaultes: and yet for all that, we haue not beene forſaken and left, vntill ſuch time as we withdrawe our ſelues from God.</p>
            <p>Moreouer Dauid ſpeaking here of the wicked, calleth them the proud: neither doth hee ſo intitle them without cauſe: for it is the propertie of all thoſe which truſt not in God For it can not be choſen, but that a man which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not his truſt in God, muſt needes growe proude, and ſwell therewith like a toade. And why ſo? For when men do know them ſelues to bee ſuch as in deede they are, they muſt needes be caſt downe and humbled. And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prouer be which reigneth euen amongs the faithleſſe, ſaith, he that knoweth him ſelfe, maketh very litle of his painted ſheath. Now we will ſpeake this with the mouth but yet it is to our condemnation. Neuertheleſſe, it is God his will
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7694:63"/>that all men ſhould know this, bicauſe there ſhould be no excuſe. In ſumme this is very true, that if men knewe them ſelues, thy ſhould be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, and vtterly diſcomfited. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they would come to ſeeke God, and hide themſelues vnder the ſhadowe of his wings, they would haue recourſe to him, to be aided in all their neceſsities. Contrariwiſe (as I haue already touched) it muſt needes be that all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les be ful of arrogancie and preſumption, to lift themſelues vp againſt God, to promiſe wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders as of themſelues, where in very deede they haue nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither yet are any thing.</p>
            <p>See now wherefore Dauid in this place ſpeaking of the faithleſſe and enemies of God, calleth them proude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is not onely here, but the holy ſcripture vſeth this ſpeache throughout. And herevpon alſo it is that the Prophet Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuc ſaieth, <hi>That a man ſhall liue by his faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Abac.</hi> 2.4.</note> And hee ſetteth downe to the contrary, that they which lift vp them ſelues, and in ſuch ſort ſome out their pride, ſhall neuer take hold: they may well make a faire ſhew, but it can not be but that they muſt needes fall downe hedlong. Wee ſee then, that the Prophet comparing the faithfull with the faithleſſe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this title and qualitie to all thoſe which put not their truſt in God. That they are puffed vp, and preſume without meaſure. Euen ſo then, let vs note, that if wee will render a true teſtimonie of our faith, we muſt needes be caſt downe in our ſelues, &amp; be truely humbled. And contrariwiſe, if we feele, that pryde puffeth vs vp, let vs conclude, that we haue as yet profited very ſlenderly in the ſchoole of God, &amp; that if faith reigned in our ſoules, that this pride ſhould there be corrected. See then, howe wee ought to put this leſſon in practiſe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let vs alſo note, that they which ſo lifte them ſelues vp againſt God, contemne and deſpiſe their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that all they which preſume vpon their own power and ſtrength, knowing not, that their whole bleſſedneſſe lyeth in the mere grace of God, theſe men I ſaye, can not be but cruell: and will be fierſe and malicious againſt their
<pb facs="tcp:7694:64"/>neighbours. And therfore, after that wee ſhall haue learned to humble our ſelues before God, let vs vſe ſuch curteſie and gentleneſſe vnto men, as that we practiſe that which Saint Paul ſpeaketh of:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3.</note> to wit, <hi>That euery man eſteeme of his brother better than of him ſelfe.</hi> Let vs not ſtudy to go about to aduaunce and eſteeme of our ſelues, in reiecting and naught ſetting by of others, but let vs acknowledge the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites which God hath beſtowed vppon euery one of vs, and confeſſe the infirmities &amp; vices which be in our ſelues: to the ende we might be humbled, and rather commende and prayſe others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let vs nowe come to this complaint, and proteſtation which Dauid maketh:</p>
            <q>The proud haue had mee exceedingly in deriſion: yet haue I not ſhrinked from thy lawe.</q>
            <p>When he ſaieth, that the proude haue had him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in deriſion, there is no doubt, but that hee meaneth that they derided him for his ſimplicitie, bicauſe hee put his truſt in God. Very well ſay they, he thinketh that God ſhould dandle him in his lappe, but we no we ſee what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him.</p>
            <p>Loe the combattes wherewith Satan daily aſſaileth vs. When as the vngodly do ſee the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God in any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie and calamitie, they ruſhe euen vpon them at the firſt daſhe and ſay, ha, ha, this man thinketh that God ought to watche ouer him, and that no ſorowe nor grief ſhoulde come vpon him, and nowe we ſee what is become of him. And bicauſe hee hath heard him ſpeake, hee thinketh that God ſhould neuer forſake him. But we ſee now what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of it. It is very true, that the vngodly of their owne motion and inclination, will ſoone vomit out ſuch blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but ſurely this commeth a great deale farther of, for it is Satan that putteth it into their mindes &amp; puſſheth them on thereto, to the ende to ſhake their faith, and vtterly to ouerthrowe it.</p>
            <p>Nowe this is not the firſt time alone that Dauid hath beene thus aſſailed: for this was an ordinarie thing with him: as wee ſee throughout the whole two and twentieth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7694:64"/>Pſalme, and ſince he hath put his truſt in God, ſay they, let him now ſaue him: and let vs ſee whether God will helpe him or not. And as Dauid was grieued with theſe torments there is no doubt but that Ieſus Chriſte hath abidden the like conflictes.</p>
            <p>And ſince that this appertained to the ſonne of God, we haue to note, that it can not bee choſen but that it muſt ſpread it ſelfe throughout his members, &amp; that euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man muſt bee exerciſed with ſuch temptations. And therefore, if we ſee the wicked, and the enemies of God ieſt and ſcoffe at vs when as we are in affliction, taking occaſion thereby to lift vp their hornes, and to deride vs, let vs not yelde for all that: but let vs remaine firme and conſtant, ſince that Dauid hath ſhewed vs the way: and not onely he, but alſo our Lord Ieſus, vnto whome we muſt be like: and therefore we muſt be of a luſty courage to follow him. And thus much for the firſt point. For the ſecond, let vs note that we haue not warre with men, when as the vngodly do ſo riſe againſt vs, and vomitte out ſuch mockeries: the ſame ſay I, commeth not from them: but it is Satan that caſteth his dartes at vs, and meaneth mortally to wounde vs. And to put by theſe blowes, wee had neede to bee armed with the woorde of God, which is our ſword, with the buckler of faith, and the Helmet of hope: euen as Saint Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs to doe. Marke well this point: we muſt not bee too too tyed vnto men, when as they ſhall thus grieue and vexe vs: but wee muſt looke a great way farther: to witte, vnto Satan, who by ſuch aſſaultes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>battes goeth about al hee can too ouerthrowe our ſayth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.16.17</note> if it were poſsible for him to doo. Now the proteſtation which he maketh, is well woorthy the noting: for after hee had complayned of theſe rebukes and mockeries of the vngodly, hee addeth, <hi>yet haue I not ſhrinked from thy way, O Lorde.</hi> Let vs then conclude, that ſince wee haue the word of God, that if al the world, ſhoulde conſpire againſt vs too turne vs from it, we ought too abyde ſtedfaſtly in it, and too bee faſt tyed thereto, and too cleaue ſo harde vntoo it, as that wee might neuer bee
<pb facs="tcp:7694:65"/>pulled away from the ſame. To this ende ought this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation to ſerue vs: to witte to ſtrengthen vs in conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that wee might knowe, that if Dauid was ſo ſtedfaſtly ſetled in the hope which he had: that the truthe of God is not at this day diminiſhed or decreaſed.</p>
            <p>It behoueth vs then to make the promiſes of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and to be ſo ſure and certaine, as that wee be not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor moued, for all the ſcornes and mockes which the wicked can make at vs. Let vs alſo marke, that Dauid ſpeaketh not here of one combat, or of a woorde caſt out at randon, as ſometimes it may eſcape from the mouth of a Scoffer or Ieſter among the wicked. But it muſt needes bee that the holy Prophet was throughly ſooked in them: as hee him ſelfe declareth, that they derided and ſcoffed at him, and that exceedingly. Let vs applie this too our ſelues, that we quaile not, nor faynt for one conflict, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Satan ſhall aſſayle vs by his ſubſtitutes: but that wee perſeuere in all conflictes, that when we ſhall haue made an ende with the firſt, to bee ready and preſt to enter into an other, neuer altering or chaunging, our determination nor will, come there whatſoeuer ſhall come: that the ſcoffes &amp; ſcornes of the wicked, yea and whatſoeuer Satan ſhall craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily inuent againſt vs, hinder vs not from ſtedfaſtly abiding and continuing in faith, without turning or writhing vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye from the lawe of God, after the example of Dauid, as here wee haue heard him make thereof proteſtation.</p>
            <p>And if there were ſuch conſtancie in Dauid, hauing the lawe onely, wee that haue the doctrine, which is giuen by him, and by the Prophetes after him, by our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, and his Apoſtles: wee then which haue a great many moe conuenient helpes, then Dauid had, ſhould wee be ſhaken and cruſſhed, when as the deuill, the wicked, and all the girnardes and firebrandes of hell, ſhall aſſayle our faith? There remaineth nowe no excuſe for vs, ſeeing hee hath done thus. Let vs then learne too helpe our ſelues with the meanes which God hath giuen vs, and putteth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7694:65"/>in to our hande, ſo that his woorde bee not vayne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable vnto vs, but that it ſerue vs in deede as it ought. Nowe hee addeth,</p>
            <q>For I remembred thine euerlaſting iudgement O Lorde: and haue receiued comfort.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid declareth that hee is confirmed (ouer and beſide the worde) in all the iudgementes of God, which is the thing that we muſt alſo do, after that we haue medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated vppon the promiſes of GOD, by which hee teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that hee is nere vnto all thoſe which call vppon him, after that wee haue knowne that which hee declareth and pronounceth, to humble and ouerthrowe the wicked, in ſhewing them to be their iudge: that ouer and beſides this, we would acknowledge as at all times we haue neede, how he hath holpen and ſuſtained his, howe hee hath deliuered them out of all the miſeries they were in: and beſides, how he hath ſtretched foorth his arme againſt the wicked, and contempners of his iuſtice. See, I ſay, howe wee muſt linke together the woorkes of God with his word, for the more notable confirmation of our faith.</p>
            <p>And this is it which Dauid meaneth in this place: for he ſpeaketh not here of the iudgementes of God as hee hath done before, and as he will hereafter: to witte, for his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and commaundementes: but hee meaneth the actes and deedes which GOD in all ages hath done, to ſhewe him ſelfe to be iudge ouer all men. It is very true, that ſuch judgements as God hath put in execution, are conteined in the Scripture. But by this which is here ſpoken of them, we are warned how we ought to reade ſuch hiſtories: that is, that God neuer forſaketh his faithfull: and although for a while he ſlacketh, yet will he not leaue the wicked vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the ende. Dauid then meditated on theſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and exerciſed him ſelfe in them. And ſo we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that when we haue made the word of God forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to reſiſt Satan, and al the aſſaultes wherewith he ſhal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile vs, we muſt alſo know, that God hath not only ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:66"/>but hath likewyſe ſhewed by experience, that his worde is no vayne thing, but that the execution thereof is at hand.</p>
            <p>And therefore, when as wee ſhall ſee that God ſhall put to his helping hande before our eyes, and ſhall giue vs ſo many teſtimonies of his iudgementes, it is no reaſon that wee ſhould ouerſlippe it: but ſhould haue our eyes open, and acknowledge theſe thinges as they are declared vnto vs: when as alſo wee ſhall feele any of GOD his grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, that wee ought to imprint the ſame ſurely in our myndes. Loe howe wee muſt followe Dauid, in that which hee ſayeth, <hi>O Lord, I haue remembred thy iudgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, when it is ſaid, that hee hath called to mynde the iudgementes of GOD from the beginning of the worlde, I praye you, what excuſe ſhall wee bee able too make, if wee ouerſlippe that, which hee ſetteth before our eyes? For when as at this daye GOD ſhoulde holde him ſelfe as if hee laye hidden, that wee ſhould haue no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nor proufe, that hee ſhoulde bee the iudge of the wicked and vngodly for to confounde them, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of thoſe which truſt in him, and call vppon him, yet that which is conteined in the holy Scripture, and that which we reade too bee done before wee were borne, the ſame, I ſaye, might ſuffice. But nowe ſince God decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him ſelfe vnto vs, and ſheweth vnto vs his preſence, and all this to bee caſt vnder foote through our vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, muſt not wee needes be more then culpable or blameworthy? In ſumme, let vs marke, that here the holy Ghoſt accuſeth vs of negligence: for if wee were ſuch as in deede wee ſhould be, wee ſhould applye our ſtudie to reade the holy Scriptures, where God ſheweth vs his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as it were in beautifull glaſſes, and all for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and profit. See then, how we ought to linke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which is written, with that which we daily ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, and to be confirmed throughout all the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, in ſuch ſorte as that they might ſerue as it were to ſeale vp the woorde of GOD, that it might bee of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7694:66"/>a great deale more ſtrength and force, and too magnifie the ſame when neede ſhalbe.</p>
            <p>Nowe haue we ſo remembred the iudgements of God, and are wee ſo exerciſed in them, yea euen in thoſe, I ſay, which were made before we were borne into this worlde? Whatſoeuer then that we ſhall now perceiue and marke, &amp; whatſoeuer alſo ſhalbe declared vnto vs ſo long as we liue, we ought by a more forcible reaſon, ſo much the narrowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to conſider, &amp; to bee a great deale the more confirmed in them, and not to be like vnto brute beaſtes, when as god ſtretcheth foorth his hand, &amp; giueth vs ſome teſtimonyes, that it is he alone which ſo helpeth vs: when as I ſay, God ſheweth vs this, wee muſt thinke on them in good earneſt, and ſo ſtay our ſelues in them: to wit, that we make not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them as vaine ſpeculations: but too apply all the Iudgementes of God to our vſe, ſince it is to this ende and purpoſe, that he ſheweth vs them. For when wee ſhall reade that God reuealed himſelfe to Abraham, and that hee did helpe him in ſuch a neceſſitie: Let this bee our concluſion, Very wel, that which God did vnto his ſeruaunt Abraham, is to aſſure vs, that he will doe the like for vs, and therefore we muſt euen now runne vnto God for refuge and ſuccor. See howe all the teſtimonyes which God hath lefte vnto vs in the holy Scripture of all his woonderfull works, ought to ſerue euery of vs for aydes and helpes. Nowe Dauid ſetteth downe ſoone after.</p>
            <q>I am horribly afrayd for the vngodly which forſake thy lawe.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid proteſteth that hee hath reſiſted another temptation ouer and beſides that which wee haue already ſeene. This is already a very ſore and harde combate too abyde, when as the wicked mock and ſcorne vs, as if God had deceiued vs, as if we had bin too too ſimple &amp; fooliſh to put our truſt in him. Loe heere a great trouble for miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wretched weakelings, yea and that ſuch as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be choſen, but that they muſt (at the leaſte) be mooued and aſtonyed. But this temptation which heere followeth is none of the leaſt to ouercome: as when wee ſee all the
<pb facs="tcp:7694:67"/>whole world addicted and giuen to wickedneſſe, that what ſoeuer we doe, is as it were to conſpire &amp; to lay a platforme to prouoke God his wrath, to diſtruſt him, to reiect all his graces, and to treade them cleane vnder foote. When then wee ſhall ſee men ſo eſtraunge them ſelues from God, euen to make open warre againſt him, it goeth very hardly, if we be not as it were vtterly ouercome. And yet neuertheleſſe it is, as Dauid heere proteſteth: that it is ſo farre of that he gaue him ſelfe wickedly, ſeeing the corruptions to bee ſuch as they were all ouer, as that hee was horribly affrayde for the vngodly which ſo forſooke the law of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let vs learne to be thus horribly affrayde, ſo often as we ſee men exceede in wickedneſſe: Let vs learne, I ſay, too haue recourſe vnto God, and as it were in gathering our wittes vnto vs, that we might conceiue an horrour &amp; feare, when as we ſee ſuch monſters, and ſuch things ſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt nature. If this hath beene alwayes a neceſſary doctrine, it is at this day moſte neceſſary: for let vs a little beholde what a generall confuſion there is, when as we ſhal ſee the order and doings of the Papiſtes, wee ſhall finde it to be a moſt helliſh outrage. And emongeſt vs alas, where the woorde of God ſhould be of greater power and force, yet wee ſee howe the more parte will not onely alter and chaunge the lawe of God, but deſire nothing more then euen vtterly to aboliſhe it. What is to be doone then? It is not inough that we followe not the wicked and vngodly in their impietie, and not to linke in with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, but wee muſt bee horribly afrayde, becauſe wee know that they muſt periſh as miſerable &amp; wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: &amp; therfore we ſhould be greeued and vexed: but yet a great deale the rather, when as they ſee them make open war againſt the maieſtie of God. For theſe are matters too to monſtrous, to ſee mortal men lift them ſelues vp againſt their creator, and in very good earneſt to fight againſt him. Lo then, what is heere ſhewed vnto vs by the ſpirite of God vnder the example of Dauid. And in this let vs ſee, whether we ought to couer our ſelues: with ſuch horrible, yea and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7694:67"/>moſt deteſtable filthynes &amp; vncleannes, when as any talke ſhall ariſe of the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of the maieſtie of God, &amp; of the diſcrediting of his law or worde, whether we ought I ſay, to make countenaunce as if ſuch talke were nothing, whether we ought to ſupport &amp; maintaine the ſame: and to paſſe it lightly ouer, as though we cared nothing at al for it, or that it no whit appertained vnto vs. Nowe if in this behalfe we ſhal doe ſo, it is a ſigne and token that there is neither zeale nor affection in vs. And heerin we ſhew our ſelues not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that God ſhould take vs for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which is written, <hi>The zeale of thy houſe hath euen conſumed me, and the rebukes and ſlaunders which haue bin laide vpon thee O Lorde, are come vpon me.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then we ſhall ſee the name of God to be contemned &amp; made no account off and ſhall ſee the wicked to caſte him cleane without the doores, in ſuch ſort as that they wil make no more recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the law of God, without all queſtion wee muſt not diſſemble and holde our peace, &amp; make account as though it were nothing: but if we be the ſeruaunts of God, it ſhall behoue vs not onely to be touched, but alſo to be horribly afrayd, &amp; to be as it were forlorne men when as we ſee ſuch abhomination, that it ſhould in ſuch ſort fall out, as to haue the name of God to be ſo conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by his creatures. Now for a concluſion Dauid ſaith, <hi>Thy ſtatutes haue beene my ſongues in the houſe of my Pilgrimage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was yet another great temptation to Dauid aſwel as the other, that it ſo fel out as that he was once driuen out of the countrie of Iudea &amp; was far from the temple of God, &amp; dwelt among the Pagans and Infidels. Nowe he ſayth, that notwithſtanding al this, that hee was not eſtraunged from God, nor yet from the knowledge of ſaluation: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, that he was the rather ſtirred vp to ſing prayſes vnto God, and thoſe Pſalmes which God did put in his mouth, yea euen ſuch as were taken out of the law. For we haue to note, that Dauid made not the Pſalmes, as a newe doctrine ne yet as a doctrine ſeparate from the doctrine of the lawe: but drew them from it as out of a Fountaine.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:68"/>
            <p>So then it is not without cauſe that he proteſteth heere that the Statutes of God ſerued him for Pſalmes and for ſonges, yea in ſteade of his Pilgrimages, that is to ſay, in a ſtrange Countrie in the middeſt of Infidels, when he was as it were baniſhed from the Church, that he could not bee in the Temple to make confeſſion of his faith, yet was he not for all this wickedly addicted. Nowe heere, they which are trauellers, are admoniſhed of their duetie. For albeit they ſee a greate many of enormities committed in the worlde, neuertheleſſe they are ſtedfaſtly purpoſed to holde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the feare of God, and to walke in a pure and ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conſcience, albeit they are mingled emongſt the infidels. As behold euen the very Chriſtians which are in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, although they are there priſoners, hauing no doctrine preached vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without libertie to ſerue God publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to make confeſſion of their faith as they would: yet doe they not exceed and outrage with the reſt in theſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanyes which reigne amongeſt them: but confirme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the beſt they can to the worde of God, take all their delight and pleaſure therein, and make the lawe of God their ſong, which maketh them to withdrawe themſelues from all the vanities and corruptions which they commit, ſo that they keepe them ſelues within this compaſſe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if they which are in a place where the worde of life is not taught, and doe ſo, yea euen greate ſtore of offences wherewith they may take occaſion too be drawne to wickedneſſe, and to be corrupt with the reſt: theſe, I ſay, be inexcuſable, but are commaunded to take their delighte and pleaſure in God, and in his lawe, and too incourage themſelues, taking the holy ſongs to exhorte them to well doing, what ſhall become of vs, when as wee are in a place where the Bell ringeth too call vs that we might bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by the woorde of God, to be inſtructed too call vpon his name, and to make confeſſion of our fayth? When GOD then calleth vs vnto his Schoole, and openeth his mouth to inſtruct vs, I pray you, are not we worthy of moſt horrible condemnation, when as wee ſhall doe altogither
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7694:68"/>prepoſterouſly in that, whereof Dauid heere maketh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. As we ſhall ſee very many, which can neuer bee mery, but when as they ſhall deafely hearken vnto God: &amp; if they come to a Sermon, it is onely to heare their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For whatſoeuer is ſayd vnto them, and layde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring them into the right way, they ſoone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what hath beene ſaide. Muſt not theſe mindes then be violently carried with a merueylous fury? Yes, without all doubte. And therefore let vs keepe in minde the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which Dauid heere maketh: <hi>That hee remembred the lawe of God vnto the ende.</hi> As if he had ſayd, Beholde what is the cauſe that I beeing a miſerable vacabond, caſt out of the Temple, and driuen out of my countrie, did yet neuer but ſtay vpon thee. And after that, beeing aſſayled by the Infidels, haue perſeuered in the conſideration of thy lawe, and delighted my ſelfe therein. Euen ſo alſo muſt wee doe, For if we ſee many offences and many things which might withdrawe vs from the lawe of God, let vs ouercome all that in the vertue and power of the promiſes which God hath made vs, that by them we might be confirmed in his loue and bountie, to the ende we fall not into ſuch a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as wee ſee the wicked and vngodly fall, and dayly caſte themſelues.</p>
            <p>And according too this doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the Maieſtie of our good God in acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our offences: Beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him to make vs better too feele, what taſte wee ought too take in his holy promiſes, and to be exerciſed in them, that we might valiantly fighte againſt thoſe vices which might hinder vs, to ſtay vpon his protection, and that by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his holy ſpirit we might ouercome all offences and griefes, to the ende that beeing fortifyed by his grace, wee might not haue any acceſſe to Satan, whereby hee might winne and get of vs: but that we conſtantly perſeuering in the holy vocation of this good God, might followe our courſe vntill ſuch time as he ſhall take vs out of this worlde,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:69"/>to bring vs vnto that heritage, which hee hath prepared for vs before the beginning of the worlde, and alſo which Ieſus Chriſte hath purchaſed for vs with his moſte preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloode.</p>
            <p>And that hee will not onely graunt vnto vs this grace, but alſo to all people and nations of the earth, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe eight verſes nexte before conteine none other thinge but the proteſtations which Dauid maketh in giuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly too God, &amp; ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto his law: except two requeſtes which he maketh in the ſecond verſe, &amp; in the laſt. Now (in the firſt place) he ſaith that his ſoueraigne good, and chiefe felicitie was, in that he was reſolute to keepe the law of God. It is very true, that ſome doe expounde this thus, that Dauid calleth God, <hi>his inheritance.</hi> But when as the matter ſhalbe well wayed and conſidered, the meaning is this, that he ſetteth his whole felicitie in this, that hee is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined and reſolued (as already hath bin touched) to followe that which God had ſhewed and taught him. Nowe this worde <hi>Portion</hi> in the Scripture is taken for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce: and inheritaunce is taken for the chiefeſt and moſt deſired thing that man hath. And ſo, it is as much as if hee had ſayde, That euery man might deuide it as hee woulde and luſted. As wee ſee the deſires of men too bee ſundry and diuerſe, one draweth one way, another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in deede (ſayth hee) euery man wiſheth as hee fantaſieth, but as for my ſelfe, I deſire none other bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe nor felicitie, but to content my ſelfe with the lawe of God, and when I haue this, I haue gotten a good and an excellent inheritaunce,</p>
            <p>And nowe we ſee the ſumme and effect of this firſt verſe, it remaineth that wee gather out thereof ſuch Doctrine as is therein conteined. For when wee heare Dauid ſpeake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, there is no doubt of it, but that the ſpirit of God declareth vnto vs where it is, that euery of vs muſt fully and wholely aſſure himſelfe. And this to doe, we muſt haue regarde too the deſires wherewith wee are allured by nature, for one nan is giuen too bee ambitious, another
<pb facs="tcp:7694:70"/>to be couetous, another to be lecherous. In ſuch ſorte as that men are carryed away with their deſires, as heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue declared. It is meete therefore that wee retire our ſelues from all theſe vaine and peruerſe deſires &amp; luſtes and to fight againſt all whatſoeuer may hinder vs to come vnto God: and when wee haue thus repreſſed our paſſions and fleſhly luſtes, let vs then deſire nothing elſe, but that God would drawe vs vnto him ſelfe, linke vs vnto him, and graunt vs the grace to keepe his Commaundements.</p>
            <p>But wee are oftentimes too note, that Dauid ſpeaketh heere of a concluſion, which he holdeth for moſte certaine and of no light motion: as when we haue ſometimes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to goe vnto God, yet it laſteth not long: for the fleſhe alſo pricketh vs on the other ſide, and withdraweth vs from that good, whereunto we had willingly bent our ſelues. It is not inough then to haue a little deſire, which ſoone wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cold, or rather, which waxeth euen dead through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary temptations: But we muſt holde a ſounde and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt concluſion, as Dauid heere ſpeaketh, <hi>I haue fully determined,</hi> ſaith he. He putteth in the word, <hi>to promiſe:</hi> But the Hebrues doe take it to be fully reſolued, to ſtand firme and conſtant in a matter, to the end not to varie or chaunge.</p>
            <p>Nowe (in ſumme) let vs note, that ſo long as men giue them ſelues too worldly things, they doe nothing elſe but wander: they knowe not wherein their felicitie conſiſteth, but we muſt come to this concluſion heere ſet downe vnto vs, to keepe the Commaundementes of God: &amp; then ſhall we neuer haue occaſion to haue a deſire to theſe miſerable fooliſh worldly things, which flye about in the ayre, which ſuffer them ſelues too be carryed after their friuolous and vaine deſires. For we ſhall be aſſured to choſe a good por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when as we ſhall be ſo vnited to God, by the bond of his word. Nowe as we haue already touched, the ſeconde verſe conteineth a requeſt which Dauid ſayth he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made:</p>
            <q>I made my humble petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thy preſence with my whole hart: be mercifull vnto me according to thy word.</q>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:7694:70"/>
            <p>Nowe in ſaying, that he continually prayed vnto God, heerein he ſheweth vs what the manner is to pray well: that we ſhould be conſtant to follow it, and not too be weary, not that God needeth to be importunately vrged, but it is to exerciſe our fayth, and the better to try vs, whether wee ſeeke all our felicitie in him or not. For it is ſo, that the holy ſcripture requireth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy in our prayers, eſpecially and aboue all other things, and not to pray vnto God this day, and quite forget him to morrowe, but wee muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, if we will be hearde. And loe wherein we muſt ſhewe our ſelues to haue truſted in God, that is, that although it ſeemeth to vs that he hath ſtopped his eares, yet for all that we muſt not ceaſe too goe continually vnto him, and pray vnto him an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred times aſmuch as we did before: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be no ſuperfluous labour, when as wee haue thus prayed. Loe heere as touching the perſeuerance whereof Dauid in this place ſpeaketh: Nowe ſet vs ſee what the ſubſtaunce of his prayer is, <hi>O Lorde</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>be mercifull vnto me according to thy worde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The requeſte is generall: But Dauid ſheweth the very ſpringhead of all the benefites which wee are too craue of God, and which alſo he lyberally beſtoweth vppon vs, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for our ſoules as for our bodyes: too witte, that hee is mercifull vnto vs. For God oweth vs nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we bring any thing with vs whereby wee may bee able to ſay that wee can prouoke our ſelues too doe well: But this is the whole ſumme, that he vſeth it towards vs of his meere and free liberalitie. Let vs then marke that Dauid his meaning is to ſhewe, that when God reacheth foorth his hande, liberally to beſtowe vppon vs ſo many benefites as we receiue of him: that the ſame proceedeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euen from his meere goodneſſe. Loe why he ſaith, <hi>O Lorde be mercifull vnto mee.</hi> Whetfore, whatſoeuer thinge wee deſire of God we muſt alwayes come with this minde to truſt in his goodneſſe. As howe? we muſt deſire God to pardon our offences, and to aſſiſte vs with his holy ſpirite: wee muſt beſeeche him that wee bee not ouercome with
<pb facs="tcp:7694:71"/>temptations: that hee will giue vs his grace, whereof wee are emptie and naked: that hee will feede vs: that he will heale vs when wee are ſicke, that hee will keepe vs out of daunger: or wee may make any other or particular pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers whatſoeuer. Al theſe requeſts muſt be drawne out of the Springheade: to witte, that he giueth vs this of his own goodneſſe, and that wee knowe why it is that God giueth vs ſo many benefites, aſwell for this preſent life, as alſo for the health of our ſoules: to witte, becauſe hee hath pittie and compaſſion vppon vs, and that wee are miſerable and poore Creatures, without he inclyned himſelfe to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto vs.</p>
            <p>To bee ſhorte, before wee enter into all the particular prayers which wee make vntof God, let vs beginne at this ende, and let it be the foundation whereon we muſt build: That God hath pittie and compaſſion vpon vs. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſhould be aſſured in our prayers, Dauid addeth this which heal ready before ſayde to witte, <hi>according too thy word:</hi> For if we deſire of God that which ſeemeth good in our owne eyes, and that wee haue not his promiſe, that hee will heare vs, this commeth of preſumption: and therefore wee muſte come humbly and ſoberly with our Prayers, and not after a wandering and careleſſe manner, neither muſt wee come before God with ſhameleſſe face, and boldelyer then we woulde come before men: but too come vnto him in ſuch modeſte and ſober manner: as that nothing eſcape our mouthes without good warrant, which thing wee are not able too doe, except wee bee aſſured that all our Prayers are according to his heartes deſire, and that he alloweth, and ratifieth them. And how ſhall this be doone? When as he ſhall haue ſayde, that wee ſhoulde not followe our owne braine, giuing the raines too our owne wittes: but that when God ſhal ſay, Loe what I would haue you to craue of mee, come vntoo mee, and make your requeſtes in this ſorte: O, according too thoſe promiſes of God, we may aſſure our ſelues to come vnto him after the example of Dauid and ſay, <hi>O Lorde bee mercifull vnto mee
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7694:71"/>according to thy word.</hi> And this is an holy preſumption, and ſuch one, as God alloweth. Nowe wee ought the better to note this doctrine, when wee ſee that it hath not onely beene obſcured and darkened in the worlde, but alſo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly made voyde: As at this day it is in Popery, for when they pray vnto God, they pray at all aduenture. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, this is one of the poyntes that the Papiſtes ſtriue moſt about, that wee muſt not aſſure our ſelues (when wee pray vnto God) that hee heareth vs: but remaine in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Forſooth, but the ſcripture telleth vs that it is not poſſible that the man which is thus floating, as the waues which are toſſed with the winde and tempeſt, ſhoulde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any thing. It telleth vs that when we come vnto God, that we muſt come with faith, hope and boldeneſſe.</p>
            <p>And ſo then, (as I haue already touched) this is an holy and a commendable preſumption, that when wee ſtay our ſelues vppon the worde of God, to ſet downe in ſumme that hee will accompliſh that which hee hath promiſed vs: For we hold him as one bound vnto vs: not that he is any thing in our debte: but becauſe that of his meere liberality, he ſtoupeth ſo lowe, as to declare vnto vs that hee woulde, that wee ſhould haue this libertie and leaue to preſent our ſelues ſo before him, with ſuch boldeneſſe, and aſſuraunce, as already I haue declared. And thus much for the ſecond verſe. In the thirde it followeth:</p>
            <q>I haue conſidered myne owne wayes: and turned my feete vnto thy Teſtimonyes.</q>
            <p>This proteſtation is woorth the noting: For wee are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, why it is that men ſo greatly flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in their own follyes and deuices, and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues beleue, that they will make their Prayers vnto God albeit they reſt not vpon him, truſt not vnto him, neither yet followe that which hee hath commaunded them, but onely their owne imaginations.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:72"/>
            <p>And that forſooth in ſuch ſorte, as that they thinke a man ſhould offer them great wrong, if hee ſayd, that all is loſte labour which they haue beſtowed: &amp; that they greatly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented themſelues to no purpoſe, except they did knowe that God hearde them. It is moſt true, that euery one will ſay, And howe ſo I beſeech you? wherefore wil not God think wel of that which I doe, ſince it is my finall intent to to ſerue him? no, no, God forceth not of all this. And what is the cauſe that men ſo arrogauntly ſtriue and ſpurne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? It is becauſe they call not their wayes too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce: For it they had this conſideration and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to looke narrowly vnto their dooings, and to think thus with them ſelues. Howe ſhall I doe? In what caſe am I? I muſt not goe aſtray, but keepe a ſure and certaine way and good meane: and to conſider how to liue: and aboue all, I muſt do thus much, as that God be not diſappoynted of the ſoueraintie which he hath ouer his.</p>
            <p>So then, when as men looke well to their wayes, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certaine and ſure, that they will wholely giue themſelues to followe the woorde of God, and therein take all their delight. And this is it that he ſayth on the contrary part, that he would turne his feete too the teſtimonyes of God. Wherein he ſheweth too all men by his example, that they ſhoulde walke as God hath commaunded them, and not too be ruled after their owne head and brayne. For ſee from whence this madneſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, which poſſeſſeth as it were all the whole worlde, that euery man will ſerue God as he thinketh beſt: It is becauſe we turne not our feete vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Teſtimonyes.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee ought ſo much the more too practize this which is heere declared: to witte, to looke too our wayes: that wee ſhoulde knowe that ſeeing that God hath placed vs heere in this worlde, that he hath not doone it too that ende that we ſhould doe whatſoeuer our ſenſes would lead vs vnto: But our life muſt be ordered &amp; ruled. And whence muſt wee haue this rule? Euen from the woorde of God.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7694:72"/>And when as wee ſhalbe ſo carefull as too order and rule our life, there remaineth no more for vs to doe, but to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe euen whether our God calleth vs. Loe the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes of God, loe his trueth which hee hath declared vnto vs: Loe, there muſt we place and ſet our ſelues. Wee muſt neuer heereafter make any more queſtion too wander any longer, and to diſcourſe and ſay, why ſhoulde not this bee good and commendable? No forſooth, not ſo, let not vs followe our owne fantaſies, neither let vs bee wiſe in our owne conceits: but let vs conſider with our ſelues to heare our God, and obey him, loe then the effecte of this thirde verſe, where it is ſayde, That Dauid looked vnto his wayes, and that he turned his feete to the teſtimonyes of God to witte, to the lawe, where God hath declared his will. Now hee addeth:</p>
            <q>I made haſte and prolonged not the time: to keepe thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes.</q>
            <p>He continueth his purpoſe: but he ſheweth that this his affection was not ſlowe, <hi>I made haſte</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>yea and that without delay.</hi> Nowe it is not without cauſe, that Dauid putteth to this: for we ſee howe ſtraightly wee oughte too deale againſt our owne appetites: yea euen they I ſay, who are beſt affected to ſerue god, do yet com as it were halting, trayling either an arme or a leg after them, as wee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſay. And what is the cauſe heereof? We carry about with vs ſuch a number of corruptions, as that the very weight of them maketh vs to goe exceding ſlowly ſo that we haue much to doe to go on. And we know, and haue too too greate experience, howe weake our nature is, when as wee intende to doe well.</p>
            <p>Let vs then vnderſtand and knowe theſe twoo thinges, and we ſhall neuer thinke it ſtraunge, that wee are ſo ſlowe and ſlack to followe God as in deede we are: yea euen theſe two things (I ſay.) For behold, Satan wil neuer ceaſe craftily to go about to imagine whatſoeuer he poſſibly can to cauſe vs to drawe backe, he will ſet barres and pitch Hayes before vs, hee will lay Buſhes, Thornes and euill fauoured ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb facs="tcp:7694:73"/>blockes whatſoeuer which any way may hinder and let vs: that if we meane to march on but onely three paces, we ſhalbe violently carryed away to turne on this ſide and on that, not knowing what ſhall become of vs. Againe, wee ſhal be ſolicited and moued by our inordinate appetites, to drawe vs cleane awry. For if we will wholly put our truſt in God, the Deuil will drawe vs too the contrary and make vs to giue our ſelues vp too this wordly pelfe, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to all the reſt. Seeing then, that we are drawen and haled with ſo many Cart ropes, yea and are of our ſelues ſo feeble to doe good, euen burning after wickedneſſe: Alas, no maruell though wee be ſlowe too followe God, but yet for all that we muſt needed fight. It is no queſtion but that we flatter our ſelues, when as wee ſee ſuch ſlackneſſe in our ſelues and ſay, in deed it is very true ſuch is the ſtate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our nature, and againe our infirmities are ſo great as that it is an impoſſible thing for any man too diſcharge himſelfe as he ought. O deere brethren, let vs not build vpon ſuch a foundation, but let vs fight againſt our vices, and take and get vnto vs ſtrength and courage, againſt all the ſtumbling blocks and ambuſſhes which Satan ſhall lay againſt vs, that we may breake all the bandes and Cordes wherewith hee holdeth vs bound. See I ſay howe we ought to doe in this caſe. For, let vs not thinke but that Dauid was a man, paſſionate as we are, and felt in himſelfe greate infirmities: neither made he proteſtation of this in vaine, when he ſayth, that he haſted and made no delay to doe the Commaundementes of God. And ſo let vs haſte, after his example, when God ſpeaketh, and let vs bowe downe our eares to heare him, and lift vp our foote to obey that which he ſhall ſay vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Loe then what Dauid meaneth to declare vnto vs in this place: to witte, what readyneſſe ought to be in all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, to heare his worde, and to receiue it, and not to deferre from day to day: For wee knowe not what time God will giue vs the grace to offer his woord vnto vs. They
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7694:73"/>which in ſuch ſorte delay the time, doe make their account that God is greatly bound and beholden too attend vpon them. Now we ſee how he ſcorneth ſuch our arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, when as wee pray vnto him with ſuch tearmes and conditions. Wherefore, we ought a greate deale the more too force our ſelues, to the ende to attaine to that perfection, after the example which is heere ſet downe vnto vs, too runne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay ſo often as God ſhall haue mercy vppon vs. It followeth ſoone after, that Dauid was not giuen too doe wickedly notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all the wrongs which the wicked had done vnto him, and had perſecuted him with all the greefes and conflictes which he had ſuſtained.</p>
            <q>Albeit <hi>(ſayth he)</hi> that the hands of the vngodly haue robbed me: yet haue not I forgotten thy law.</q>
            <p>This is not heere put to without a cauſe. For wee ſhall heerein ſee very many which are peaceable and moderate inough, when as they be not greeued, but ſuffred to runne their owne courſe; But if any trouble ouer take them, and that they be moleſted, beholde then are giue to doe wickedly, then alter they their determination and purpoſe, and chaunge their coppy. So then, becauſe men are ſo eaſy to be drawne to euill, although before, they followed the thing that was good: ſee therefore we ought diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to note this place, which Dauid heere addeth. For it is as it were to ratifie that which he hath before ſpoken of the ready neſſe to followe the woorde: becauſe that that had not beene inough, without he had beene ſo confirmed in it. For although the Deuill had ſo lyen vpon him, euen too haue diſcouraged him, yet was he not without hope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to make his parte good againſt him.</p>
            <p>And ſo muſte wee alſo doo in this caſe. When our Lorde then ſhall ſette vs in the way, and ſhall giue vs ſome good motions: let vs beſeech him ſo to confirme vs in the ſame, as that when the Deuill ſhall goe aboute for too aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle vs, wee might repulſe and ouer come all the aſſaultes wherewith hee ſhall aſſayle vs: and alwayes too continue
<pb facs="tcp:7694:74"/>and remaine in our determination and purpoſe without chaunge. Loe the thinge which is heere declared vnto vs.</p>
            <p>And we are alſo to note that there are two temptations, which we muſt reſiſt, when as wee ſhall be greeued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried. The firſt temptation is, that when we are iniuried, we are by and by mooued too render the like: Marke I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you the ſtate and condicion of our nature. Nowe ſince God commaundeth vs to flye that which is naught, &amp; to, doe that which is good, euen to loue our enemyes, wee had neede tobee very well armed and furniſhed with theſe textes of the Scriptures. For wee ſhall neuer bee able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the ende to ouer come any ſuch temptation nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuenge, excepte God putteth to his helping hande. We think it alſo lawfull to doe euill, when we ſee our ſelues compaſſed with nothing elſe but euill, and wickedneſſe, if we looke into the order and gouernment of the world, wee ſhall ſee one man exceede in lechery, another to be an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemer, one an extortioner &amp; vſurer, and another a deceitfull bargainer, one in this thing another in that: &amp; very many eſtranged from God, and become neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to Satan, viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly carried to this &amp; that. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as then we are thus incompaſſed with euil and iniquitie, we thinke that we may take leaue to doe wickedly.</p>
            <p>Loe how the children of God may be tempted, and how we ſee a;ſo and infinite number to be as it were dayly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And therefore let vs note, that if wee haue at any time beene boldely affected too come vnto God, and that hee hath reached foorth his hande for a ſeaſon, to haue vs too come vnto him, that yet this is not inough: But wee muſt heereupon indeuour our ſelues too gather vnto vs newe force and courage, to the ende the Deuill might not ſhake vs when as hee ſhall rayſe vpp againſt vs troubles and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and lay a great number of ſtoppes and ſtumbling blocks in our wayes. Wee muſte therefore bee armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte him, to the ende wee forget not the Lawe of God, whatſoeuer come of it.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:7694:74"/>
            <p>And here we are to note this circumſtance, that Dauid doth not onely ſaye, that he was greued by one man alone, ne yet by two or three, but he ſayeth, <hi>The congregation of the wicked.</hi> When he ſayeth, <hi>The whole congregation,</hi> this is very much: if there had beene but a ſmall number, it had beene enough: But he ſayeth, <hi>The whole congregation,</hi> ſignifying that he was aſſayled on euery ſide, that he was like a ſheepe amonge Wolues, Lyons, Beares, and other wilde beaſtes of rauyne: and yet for all that, that he always put his truſt in the Lorde.</p>
            <p>Now if we ſhall looke well into our ſelues, how few ſhall we ſee which haue not beene ouercome with the leaſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that hath come vnto them? there ſhall neede but one man to oppoſe him ſelfe againſt vs, and loe we are by and by carried to do wickedly, now we knowe not that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from God. To be ſhort, the leaſt flie which flieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes (as we ſaye) is euen enough to turne vs quite out of the right way. And ſurely we may be greatly aſhamed ſo ſuddainly to change our copie: where before wee made great ſhowe of following of God, and by and by to goe cleane againſt the haire. And we thinke this may be a moſt lawefull excuſe, when as we can handle the matter thus, to ſay, that we were carried to doe wickedly through ſome te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It is ſo farre of that this excuſe ſhould goe for paye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that it is neither worth ware nor money. But wee muſt ſeye with Dauid, yea and that truely as he hath done, That whenſoeuer the whole congregation of the wicked ſhall aſſaile vs, let vs not ceaſe to perſeuer and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in the lawe of God. And namely he ſayeth, <hi>That they haue robbed him,</hi> which is yet the moſt grieuous and ſharpe thing that can come to a man, and which might ſooneſt make him to quaile. For it may be that the wicked will go about to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt vs, and yet come not to the ende of their enterpriſe: but Dauid ſaith, that he was put out for a pray, that he was as a wretched forlorne creature, and aſſayled on euery ſide: and yet that he forgot not the lawe of God. And in ſo ſaying, it is as if he ſhould haue proteſted and ſayde, that hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb facs="tcp:7694:75"/>one ſelfe and the ſame affection to followe the lawe of God.</p>
            <p>Now let vs returne vnto that which we haue before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For this is no ſmall temptation, that God ſuffereth vs to be ſo moleſted, greeued, and tormented. When GOD ſuffereth Satan and his ſuppoſtes too take this courſe, this ſhould as it were diſcourage vs an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth thouſand times. And in very deede this is Satan his policie, as we ſee in Iob. For when Satan ment to ſhewe, that it was an eaſie matter for Iob to ſerue God. <hi>O,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>he is wel at libertie, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth quietly, he is rich, and therefore it is a very eaſy matter for him, to prayſe God: but whenſoeuer he ſhall haue loſt all that hee hath, all his ſubſtance, and be vexed with many anoyannces and tormentes, we ſhall then ſee whether he will bleſſe God yea or no.</hi> Loe then howe God proueth vs, when he ſuffereth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to moleſt and trouble vs, that they are euen come to this point to ſet their foote vpon the very throat of vs. By that he meaneth to proue vs whether we loue him in good earneſt or not. And therefore wee are the rather to marke this doctrine. For it is impoſsible for vs to ſerue God as we ought, without wee haue this conſtancie whereof Dauid here ſpeaketh: to wit, that when we ſhalbe afflicted in any ſort whatſoeuer, wee muſt not ceaſe to praye alwayes vnto God, that we may be able to yeld our ſelues wholy to him. Loe what is the ſumme and effect hereof. And by this wee are taught, that neither afflictions nor any ſuch other like things ought to ſtay vs from praying vnto God, to the end we might alwayes walke in his obedience. For if he permit vs to be afflicted in our fleſh, we muſt not therefore ſay that his loue is diminiſhed towardes vs, neither that hee hath litle care of our ſaluation: let vs onely attend and wayte to ſee the ende and iſſue of our afflictions, and in the meane, while continue to walke according to his word, and neuer forget his lawe, howſoeuer Satan ſoliciteth vs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Nowe it followeth by and by after,</p>
            <q>At midnight will I riſe to giue thankes vnto thee: bicauſe of thy righteous iudgements.</q>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:7694:75"/>
            <p>Loe here an excellent proteſtation, which alſo hangeth vppon that, whereof wee haue already treated in the firſt verſe. For there Dauid proteſteth that this is our true and very perfect felicitie, when as wee giue our ſelues to GOD and too his woorde.</p>
            <p>Nowe hee ſayeth heere, that <hi>hee roſe at midnight too giue thankes vntoo God, euen bycauſe of his rightuous Iudgementes.</hi> As if hee ſhoulde haue ſaide, I haue already declared, O Lorde, that my portion is too haue thy woorde, and too haue poſſeſsion thereof: which if I haue, I am bleſſed, and moſt bleſſed: And nowe, O Lorde, ſuffer mee not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankeful for ſuch a benefite, and priuiledge, whiche thou haſt giuen mee. He alledgeth alſo vntoo him his rightuous Iudgements. We haue here before declared what the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe wordes importe: too wit, <hi>the Statutes of God:</hi> which are to gouerne vs in ſuch ſoundnes as that oure life ſhal bee playne and honeſt, Dauid then, ſaying <hi>that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God bicauſe of his rightuous Iudgementes,</hi> ſignifieth, that hee thanketh him for that, that he was taught in his word, knowing it too bee a ſingular benefite. Wee are nowe too note this ſaying. For wee ſee what our vnthankefulneſſe is, not onely for al the benefites of GOD, but principally and chiefely for this, that God hath ſo declared himſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by his lawe: Prophetes and Goſpel, and yet wee neuer thinke of al this: and that which is worſe, that although he meaneth too ouercome our malice through his goodneſſe, and offered himſelf vnto vs as a father and Sauiour, yet do wee fly as farre from him as wee poſsibly can. It is very true that we will make ſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſeeke him, as it were for our diſcharge, yea and that ſhal bee too, when as wee ſhal bee theretoo forced: But yet if wee were at oure owne liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and choyſe, wee woulde come as farre aloofe as were poſsible.</p>
            <p>Nowe when wee ſeeke God in this wyſe, it is not too come directly vntoo him, but onely too ſay, Loe I am well affected vntoo GOD, I am one of thoſe which ſeeke him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:76"/>
            <p>And in deede, when God goeth about to drawe vs vnto him by his worde, how may we be able ſufficiently enough to vnderſtand ſo notable a benefite? Wherefore let this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be well marked, ſeeing it is ſo very neceſſarie to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and amend our ſo great villainous malice and vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe? and that wee might hereafter learne to praiſe God, bicauſe it hath pleaſed him to make vs partakers of this ineſtimable treaſure, to wit, the doctrine of ſaluation: that his meaning is to rule &amp; order our life, that we might not be like wretched ſtrayed ſheepe, to be caſt downe hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the bottomleſſe pitte of hell. Here is likewiſe an ardent affection expreſſed in this ſaying. <hi>That Dauid aroſe at midnight.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid, that the daye was not ſufficient enough for him, but that in the time of his quiet teſt, he lifted vp his minde into heauen to giue thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. In this he ſignifieth that he continued prayſing of God without weeriſomneſſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe then, if wee will rightly followe the example of Dauid, we muſt not giue GOD thankes when wee thinke good, and when we ſhall haue remembred him ones in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene dayes, or I knowe not when: or els when as it ſhalbe for faſhions ſake, as when the Bell ringeth to cauſe vs too come to the Sermon. But it muſt be alwayes, for wee muſt both in the euening, and morning, and alſo at midnight, haue our minees waking to giue him thankes. He addeth,</p>
            <q>I am a compaignion of all them that feare thee: and keepe thy Commaundementes.</q>
            <p>By which hee ſignifieth, that hee hath ſought all the meanes poſsible too giue him ſelfe to walke in the feare of God. We haue here to note, that Dauid was an excellent man, euen like an Angell amonges mortall creatures: and yet for all that, it was needeful for him to accompanie him ſelf with faithfull men, men of good example, and pure, and holy in life and conuerſation. And why ſo? To the ende he might be alwayes the better confirmed in his vocation and calling, and not to be withdrawne from the ſame by euill example. Nowe (as I haue already touched) if Dauid had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7694:76"/>neede hereof, what ſhall become of vs, who are ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and mutable in al our doings? Lo then the firſt point which we haue to note in this place: to wit, that Dauid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth that although the holy Ghoſt aſsiſted him, and that he felt him ſelfe confirmed, as wee haue ſeene, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, he yet ſought other helpes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue and hold him in the feare of God: as the companies which were moſt meete for him, to cauſe him to followe his vocation, and not to withdrawe him from it, ſeeing there muſt be nothing that muſt pull vs aſide from the right way. Now he meaneth to ſignifie further, that he ioyned him ſelfe with men that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, to the ende alſo that hee might ſerue him as hee ought. For we are bound to ſtirre vp one another through mutual exhortations and good enſamples. It is meete then that we haue theſe twoo conſiderations: in the firſt place we are to conſider to followe thoſe which can aduaunce &amp; further vs in the right waye, who can profite vs more and more in the feare of God, and after that, wee muſt alſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to to profite thoſe with whome wee ſhalbe likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant, inciting them by all meanes poſsible, to followe the right trade, wherein God ſhall haue ſet them, to the ende he may be honoured with one accord: and that euery of vs might ſay, come, let vs goe, and let vs trauell and take paines to cauſe to others to goe with vs, that wee may altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honour the Lord our God. Now the concluſion of the eight verſe, is the ſecond requeſt.</p>
            <q>The earth O Lorde is full of thymercie: O teach mee thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>Here we ſee howe neceſſarie a thing it is for vs to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes praying to God, beſeeching him more amply to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs, that we may acknowledge him better then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we haue done: yea, and that ſpecially, when as wee thinke we knowe al that is to be knowne, that we through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, that wee haue yet great neede to profite conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually more and more. For, which of vs, I pray you, dareth be ſo bolde as to compare with Dauid? Loe ſo excellent a Prophet, as that he is like vnto an Angel of God: wee ſee
<pb facs="tcp:7694:77"/>alſo how God hath reueled vnto him his ſecrets, as if he had bin taken vp into the heauenly kingdom: &amp; yet he hauing ſuch excellent gifts as we know, deſireth notwithſtanding to be inſtructed in the ſtatutes of God. And which is hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongs vs that hath not greater neede of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? So then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſhalbe greatly learned in the word of God, not onely for our ſelues, but alſo to inſtruct our neighbours: let vs for al that be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to yeld our ſelues to be taught of him, to beſeech him to grant vs his grace, that we may daily profit more &amp; more. And therefore we ought the better to note the reaſon, which Dauid ſetteth firſt down, <hi>For the earth, O Lord as ful of thy mercie.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide, thou O Lorde ſpreadeſt abrode thy fatherly goodnes ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: we ſe how of thy mercy thou feedeſt the beaſts of the field, we ſe the trees floriſh, the earth bring forth her incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſe, thy goodnes ſpreadeth through heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth, &amp; how is it then poſsible, that thou ſhuldſt not do good vnto thy children? I am one of that nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber which call on thee, &amp; that put their truſt in thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seing thou art ſo louing &amp; mercifull to al creatures, thou ſhalt not forſake me. The reaſon, here ſet down, ſerueth Dauid for a confirmation, that he ſhould not dout to obtaine the requeſt which he had made. And ſo as oft as we deſire God to inſtruct vs in his ſtatuts, the good nes dout to obtaine the requeſt which he had made. And ſo oſt as we deſire God to inſtruct vs in his ſtatuts, the good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, wherwith he ouerſpreadeth al his creatures ſerueth vs as a foundation, wheron to build al our petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And ſince that God hath giuen vs this grace to allow vs in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his children, and to ſhew him ſelt to be our father, let vs be ſure that he wil not refuſe to giue vs thoſe things which he hath promiſed. And according to this holy doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the Maieſtie, &amp;c.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:7694:78"/>
            <p>And this is the ſumme and effect of theſe eight verſes, which here we haue nowe to handle. For Dauid demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of God none other thing but to knowe the contents of the lawe, and the doctrine thereof; that he might be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereby, and his whole life framed thereafter.</p>
            <p>But in the firſt place he remembreth God of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites which he had already receiued from him. For that it which muſt giue vs truſt and confidence, when as wee come to make any prayer vnto God. And in deede there is nothing in the world which giueth vs a better acceſſe, nor that doth more readily aſſure vs to be heard, then when we beholde his benefites beſtowed vpon vs. And howe muſt that bee? Thus muſt euery man conſider with him ſelfe and ſay, I haue found heretofore by experience the bountie of my God: yea, I haue had as great prouſe hereof, as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And therefore it were vnreaſonable that I ſhoulde mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt him, and ſtande in any doubt that he would not now graunt me that which I deſire of him: conſidering that I haue ſo good a proufe of his loue, that he is alwayes ready, liberally to beſtowe vpon mee his benefites. When then I ſhall haue receiued ſo many benefites of him, ſhould I now thinke with my ſelfe, howe is it poſsible that this thing ſhould come to paſſe? to witte, that I ſhould obtaine that which I am about to praye for? If wee ſhall ſtande in this doubt, we ſhall do God great wrong, and ſhewe our great vnthankefulneſſe vnto him: for he neuer doth vs any good, but it is to this ende and purpoſe, that we ſhould be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his mercie and grace, which hee will continue vnto vs euen to the ende: for he is neuer wearie in liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing his benefits vpon vs, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are wont when as they beſtow bountifully of any, and by &amp; by plucke their heads againe quite out of the coller. But God is no ſuch maner of one, he is a well that can neuer be drawne drie. Loe then whereunto this tendeth which is here ſpoken in the firſt verſe: <hi>O Lorde, thou haſt dealt gratiouſly with thy ſeruant,</hi> Dauid ſpake not this to the ende to meaſure him ſelfe, that he would haue God neuer hereafter to beſtowe any moe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7694:78"/>benefites vpon him: But cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, that bicauſe he had had already ſo great experience of the grace of God, he was fully reſolued, that hee ſhoulde alſo feele his benefites too come. For God is no chaungling: and as I haue already ſaide, his grace is neuer leſſened, but hee will alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it towardes vs. And ſo let vs learne after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Dauid, that as often as we are to praye vnto God, to conſider with our ſelues, and call to minde, the benefites which we haue receiued from his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that the ſame might be as it were an entrance for vs vnto prayer, and therevpon to conclude, that ſeeing God hath ſhewed him ſelfe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore liberall: wee ſhould feele him alſo to bee the ſame, euer hereafter vnto the ende.</p>
            <p>Now namely Dauid addeth, <hi>According to thy word:</hi> And not without cauſe: for this is not al that we ought to know, that God hath done vs good, and that al that we haue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceadeth from him:but wee muſt put this confidence vnto it: to wit, that he hath done it according to his word. For like as meate, although it be good and ſweete, hath no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour nor taſte, but is altogether vnſauery without ſalt: euen ſo likewiſe the benefites of God, will haue no perfect taſte, that we might ſauour them as appertaineth, if it bee not, that they bee ſalted and ſeaſoned with faithe and belief, and too knowe that the graces and benefites which GOD hath beſtowed vppon vs, haue beene according to his worde &amp; promiſe. And why ſo I pray you ? For if we ſhal not haue the worde of God and his promiſes: yea and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (as I haue already ſaide) wee might very well make our petitions vnto him, and come before him, in building our ſelues vpon this, that hee hath already ayded vs of his meere fauour and goodneſſe: yet ſhould we not for al that, be aſſured that hee will alwaies doe the like, ne yet abide conſtant therein, that when hee hath begunne, that he will finiſhe it, wee can neuer bee able, I ſaye, too haue any ſuch certaintie without his woorde. And why ſo? when God ſayeth vnto vs, goe to nowe, and hearken vnto me, I wilbe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:79"/>your father, and ſhewe my ſelfe ſauiour towardes you, and you ſhall finde me to be ſuch one for euer: after that we haue feit the proufe and effect of theſe promiſes: wee maye then very well applie his benefites to that vſe whereof I haue already ſpoken: hath God done mee good but for a fit? hath he done this onely, but by the waye of talke? and will he not now hold and continue it? no, not ſo: but hee hath done it according to his word. Doth the word of God ſtand but for a day or for a moneth? No, it remaineth and abideth both in life and death. Let vs then conclude, that the benefites of God are euerlaſting, and that he wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them vnto all thoſe that are not vnthankefull. Loe this ſentence which Dauid addeth is not ſuperfluous, but of great waite, when he faieth, <hi>O Lord, thou haſt dealt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with me, according to thy word.</hi> If we will then be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the benefites of God, which wee haue heretofore receiued; and when wee ſhall make our requeſtes, that wee would haue him to heare vs: wee muſt ioyne his benefites with his word, and euen to ſpeake property, like vnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes cloſely wrapped vp together in ſauory ſalt, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhal neuer be able to feele any ſuch taſte them, as to applie then to ſuch an vſe, to builde a true certaintie of faith in him. Now Dauid hauing vſed ſuch a preface, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,</p>
            <q>O teach me good iudgement and knowledge: for I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued thy commaundements.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid deſireth God to giue him true wiſedome, that he might knowe what he had to do. And why doth he ſo? he ſetteth downe the reaſon which is that, that we haue already ſeene, <hi>for I haue beleeued,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy worde.</hi> Nowe it ſeemeth to implie, that they which haue beleeued, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtructed, that they haue, I ſaye, true vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſo great wiſedome, as they neede not to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, to inlighten them any more. Wherein conſiſteth and ſtandeth all our wiſedome but in faith? when as wee receiue the worde of God, and being taught by it doo reſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7694:79"/>vs in that which he ſaieth vnto vs? Loe this is our full and whole perfection.</p>
            <p>Nowe Dauid proteſteth, <hi>That hee hath beleued the word of God:</hi> wherefore then deſireth he to bee taught, as if hee were without knowledge and ignorant? Nowe here wee are to note (as we haue touched this morning) that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the worde of God twoo wayes: to wit, our faith muſt be diſtinguiſhed in twoo partes: not that wee meane to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, and diſmember the ſame, but to make a diſtinction of it, as is compriſed in her owne natures kind. From whence then taketh faith her beginning? Forſooth, ſhe muſt deſpiſe her ſelfe to receiue whatſoeuer God ſhall ſay, wee muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to be maiſter, and to acknowledge whatſoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from him, to be good, holy, and iuſt: that before hee hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs, we be already prepared and diſpoſed to obey him:and albeit we knowe not yet his will, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to haue this reſolution with our ſelues, dooth God ſpeake? Well then, wee muſt not onely giue our eare and attention: but alſo receiue without contradiction, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall proceede out of his holy mouth.</p>
            <p>Loe here what is the firſt part and condition of faith. Now there is a ſecond part &amp; condition: to wit, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which God giueth vs, after that we are come vnto him with that reuerence that Schollers ought to come to their maiſter: for we are more fullie and ſoundly taught of him. This is it that Dauid deſireth. He proteſteth <hi>That hee hath beleeued the woorde of God:</hi> that is to ſay, to haue knowne the maieſtie conteined therein, to haue obeyed it, and to haue yelded himſelfe ſubiect vnto the ſame. When hee had made this proteſtation, O Lorde, ſayeth he, now that I haue felt the power and vertue of thy woorde, and haue chiefly beene deſirous thereof, graunt mee this grace that I may comprehended it.</p>
            <p>Loe here a notable place and worthy the noting. For in the firſt place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are aduertiſed, that wee ſhall neuer profit our ſelues either in the Goſpel, or yet in any parte of the holy Scripture, if wee haue not this modeſtie with vs,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:80"/>as too yeelde our ſelues too God: with this perſuaſion, that the ſame which wee accompt too bee good and faythfull with vs is nothing in reſpect of that which he meaneth too doo therein on his behalfe: conſidering that hee hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed it vntoo vs:For wee are ſimple and ignorant, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceiue the thinges which are neceſſary for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vntil ſuch time as we haue yeelded our mindes to this reaſon. And loe wherefore there are ſo fewe ſchollers of God at this day in this poynt. For howe many ſhal we find at this day, which haue their mind ſo humbled as it ought? But the greater parte are arrogant fooles, wee ſhall find ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many in this behalfe, that wil make no more accompte of the woorde of God, then if a mortall and ſeelie man had ſpoken. Forſomuch then as men come thus too God with ſuch a pryde, let vs not woonder although hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them without wit or reaſon: and although the Sunne ſhyneth bright before their eyes, yet remaine they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blinde, and groape about, as it were in the darke, and wander about euen too the hazarde of their necke brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. We muſt not be abaſhed at this, although God depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them of his grace, ſince they wil not ſubmitte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vntoo his woorde. Euen ſo, when as this ſhalbe in vs to attribute vnto God the authoritie and honour which he is worthy off, wee may after the example of Dauid, hope that he will inſtruct vs more and more: and alſo make this requeſt vnto him. For this is the firſt degree and ſteppe of all Chriſtian wiſedome: to witte, to humble them ſelues in ſuch ſorte, as that they be euer ready to receiue whatſoeuer God ſhall ſay vnto them. When as they ſhalbe thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they can not do amiſſe, nor yet feare that God wil euer forſake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but that he will ſpred furth his power to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he hath therein promiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doe. And thus much as touching theſe two verſes. Now it followeth,</p>
            <q>Before I was troubled I went wrong: but nowe I keepe thy worde.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid ſignifieth that he was more dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, then euer he was, bicauſe God corrected him: As if hee had ſayd, In
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7694:80"/>very deede, O Lorde, amonges all the reſt of the benefites which I haue already alleaged, this is one, that thou haſt made me to know my ſelf through affliction: loe, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me to keepe thy commaundements. Nowe when wee tell God thus of the graces which hee hath beſtowed vpon vs that we might bee prepared to ſerue him, it is for this cauſe that he might encreaſe and augment them more and more in vs, vntill ſuch time as he hath brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their perfect end. Now we haue to note in this matter, the order which Dauid keepeth, O Lorde, ſaieth hee, <hi>I confeſſe that I haue erred.</hi> The firſt point, is this confeſsion which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: for when God findeth vs to be vntamed and hard to be kept in aray, it is meete that this our ſtubburneſſe ſhould be pulled downe, and hee to ſhewe his authoritie ouer vs, to the ende we might ſoone after feele his clemencie. And therefore, Dauid knowing that hee was once very wylde and vntamed, and had not walked in ſuch feare of God as became him, confeſſeth, that although hee had beene taught, yet that it was needefull for God to ſet him in aray, and to keepe him in good order. <hi>O Lorde</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that I haue erred, yea and that was before thou haddeſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed me: but now I keepe thy commaundementes.</hi> By this hee ſignifieth in effect, that which I haue touched: to wit, that he was already prepared in this wiſedome of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: yet he alwayes prayed that hee would aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this grace in him, and confirme him therein vntill ſuch time as he were throughly made perfect. In the meane while we haue to note, that Dauid was not a man altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wickedly bent, ne yet ſo vntamed as a great number of the contempners of God are. It is very true that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted very grieuous and extreeme offences, were it but this adulterie which hee committed with Bethſabe Vrie his wife, which was ſo horrible an acte, as that he deſerued euen for that to be vtterly forſaken of God. And after that, he became ſo proude when he woulde haue muſtred the people, as that he was violently carried with a vayne
<pb facs="tcp:7694:81"/>and fooliſh arrogancie, cleane forgetting who it was that had aduaunced him vnto this royall ſeate: and in ſteade of dooing homage vnto God for ſuch a notable benefite, hee determined with him ſelfe to haue eſcaped away on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe. Loe what grieuous and ſhamefull faultes theſe are. But if we looke into the courſe of his life, wee ſhall finde that he was a man of a continuall ſingleneſſe very teachea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of curteſie, following the vocation of God, and wholy giuen thereto. Nowe herein appeareth a great difference betweene a man which outrageth all the dayes of his life, and him which committeth ſome particular euill, ſhewing neuertheleſſe in all the reſt of his life a feare of God: As it may happen, that a man ſhall ſerue God all his life, and yet in the meane while may ſomewhat fall, and perhappes very grieuouſly: as we ſee to haue come to paſſe in Dauid. Nowe wee ſhall ſee others to be very wicked, and to deſpiſe God all their life long, delighting altogether in wickedneſſe. But Dauid neuer was ſuch one: and yet for all that he confeſſed that hee had erred, before ſuch time as God had viſited him with afflictions. And if this came ſo to paſſe in Dauid, alas what ſhall become of vs poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? So then, let vs vnderſtand that afflictions, are more neceſſarie for vs, then bread and drinke.</p>
            <p>We craue of God that he will feede and nouriſhe vs. It is very true, and hee giueth vs leaue for to make ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: but yet we muſt not leaue out the principall point: to wit, we muſt beſeech him not to make vs ſo fatte, as we, make pampered and reſtife lades, too wynſe and kicke at him, but that being gouerned through his bountiful good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we might be eaſie and tractable to bee guided accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will. So it is (as already I haue ſayde) that wee ought in deede, to be tamed through afflictions: or els wee ſhould alwaies become like vnto ſauage and wild beaſtes.</p>
            <p>And too proue that it is ſo, wee ſee our nature ſo rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as is moſt pitifull: and our affections ſuch terrible beaſtes, as that we are not able to holde them in any good
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7694:81"/>order: in ſo much that if God ſlack the reynes, and laye the brydle in our necke, it is out of all queſtion that wee will be very ſtubborne and rebellious againſt him: and in ſuch ſort outrage, that wee will deſire nothing els but clearely to ouerthrowe all iuſtice, equitie, and right. To be ſhort, it wilbe out of all doubt, that wee will euen iuſtle and ſpurne againſt God, when as we ſhall liue at our owne pleaſure, and in great proſperitie.</p>
            <p>Nowe there is none other remedie to helpe this matter, but to haue God to afflict vs, for this is the only meane, by which he keepeth vs in ſubiection and in awe, otherwiſe, if he leaue vs in reſt and at quiet, it were vnpoſsible but that our nature ſhould ſtubburnly rebell againſt him. If wee carrie away this leſſon well, wee ſhould neuer be ſo grieued with the afflictions which he layeth vpon vs as wee are:but wee ſhould take another maner of conſolation in all our miſeries and aduerſities then wee doo: knowing that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be bitter medicines vnto vs, yet that they ſhal turne to our health. Let vs choſe whether wee will be like wilde and madde beaſtes, ſtraying from the waye of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea euen like very frantique men to lifte vp our ſelues againſt God, rather then to bechaſtiſed with his roddes, and to be ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered as that by the ſame meane he might order vs to liue in his obedience.</p>
            <p>Since then we be ſo profited through afflictions, as that the gaine which we get thereby is not heauy and grieuous to beare, let vs comfort our ſelues therewith, attending the iſſue which God ſhal giue vnto vs. Moreouer, let vs alſo haue in memorie, that wee muſt not bee incorrigible, after that God hath lifte vp his hand to chaſtiſe vs, and hath rebated out fooliſh and inordinate appetites, neither moyle and groyne as we are wonted, as if he did vs great wrong: but let vs ſuffer our ſelues to be chaſtiſed and afflicted after the example of Dauid. Loe, the very ſauage and fierce beaſtes, yet for al that at laſt they may be made tame, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and induſtrious man ſhall take them in hande, which can tell howe to rule them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:82"/>
            <p>Beholde the vntamed horſe, of nature fierce and ſtout, and yet for all that he ſuffereth him ſelfe to be handled and led, turneth with the bit, when he ſhall haue a man vppon his backe which knoweth howe too ride and tame him. I beſeeche you, ought not wee to be greatly aſhamed, when as our God ſhal employe him ſelfe to order vs, and winne vs vnto him ſelſe, and yet cannot compaſſe it? So then, let vs after the example of Dauid, ſtriue to profite our ſelues vnder the rodde of God, to the ende wee might keepe his lawes, after that hee hath ſcourged vs. Nowe it followeth ſoone after.</p>
            <q>Thou art good and gratious: teach me thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>Dauid here repeateth againe the ſame petition which we haue heard. And it is the very ſame which I haue already touched: to wit, that amongs all the praiers which we muſt make vnto God, this is one of the moſt principall, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to inſtruct vs in his woorde: that wee be not giuen in ſuch ſort to that which concerneth this preſent life, and our bodies, as that wee thinke no whit of the glaſſe of our ſoules. Nowe this glaſſe is it which conſiſteth in the worde of God.</p>
            <p>So then, let vs not forget this ſo great a benefite, when as we are about to praye vnto God, that wee haue this in a moſt eſpeciall remembrance, that wee may be inſtructed in his ſtatutes. Nowe ouer and beſide this requeſt, Dauid vſeth the ſame reaſon which hee hath ſet downe in the firſt verſe: that is when he ſayeth, <hi>That God is good and gratious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true, that they are twoo ſundrie ſentences: but yet they proceede from one ſelf ſame ſpringhed, and the meaning alſo tendeth to one and the ſelf ſame ende. Hee hath ſaide, thou haſt dealt liberally with thy ſeruant: and here, thou art good and gratious. There hee hath ſayde, euen according too thy woorde: and here hee hath put them in both: ſo that wee may ſee, that this verſe is but a confirmation of that which wee haue ſeene in the twoo firſt: that Dauid alledging to GOD, his bountie, which hee vſed towardes his, euen accordinig to his nature,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7694:82"/>beſeecheth him that hee woulde teache him his Statutes. Nowe he addeth,</p>
            <q>The proude haue imagined a lye against me: but I will keepe thy Commaundementes vvith my vvhole hart.</q>
            <p>This is alledged for two reaſons: the one is, that by it Dauid ſheweth the neede which he hath of God his helpe, and to be confirmed in his worde, yea and to be inſtructed in the ſame. And why ſo? Forſooth to withſtand temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As if he had ſayd, Alas my God, if thou inſtruct mee not, and guideſt me e by thy holy ſpirite, what ſhall I doe? For I am not without temptations, when as I ſhall haue but mine owne will which euer ſtriueth againſt thee: But I haue alſo enemyes without, which oppreſſe and greeue me: Wherfore I haue very great neede to be guided and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thy hand. Dauid then conſidered that it was neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to bee chaſtiſed of God: to the ende he might a great deale the eaſelyer obtaine his requeſt.</p>
            <p>Nowe in the meane while hee meaneth too ſhewe that he made his prayer without hypocriſie: that he came too GOD in very good earneſte, and with a pure and ſincere affection: as if he had ſayd, O Lord I deſire not to be inſtructed in thy lawe and Statutes for faſhions ſake: but becauſe I eſteeme of this good that is in it, and for that I knowe this to be the moſte ſoueraigne felicitie that we can haue. And to proue that it is ſo, although the wicked haue aſſayled me, and taken great paines to drawe mee too doe wickedly, and haue bent all all their force and power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: yet haue I kept thy commaundements. By this hee hath made good proofe howe greatly hee loued the woorde of God, when as hee lothed it not whatſoeuer they craftely and malitiouſly practized againſt him.</p>
            <p>See then the two reaſons which we haue heere to note. Now (in the firſt place) when Dauid ſpeaketh heere of the proude, let vs remember that it is the title which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly attributeth to all Infidels &amp; contemners of God. For from whence commeth this villanous and beaſtly
<pb facs="tcp:7694:83"/>impietie, that men will not bowe them ſelues vnder the hand of GOD, but are hardened, and lifte them ſelues vpp againſt him? It cannot bee choſen but that this muſte needes be an horrible pride. Euen ſo then this infidelitie is it that giueth too man as it were Hornes which he ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally eſteemeth (although in deede it bee leſſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) and thinketh the ſame to be wonderfull. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, let vs marke that it is onely Fayth that muſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs to humilitie, and which frameth and faſhioneth vs therein, conſidering this ſwelling of our hearts, our grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in preſumption, like vnto ſwelling Toades. There is nothing I ſay, that can amende this vice, but Fayth alone. The reaſon is, becauſe that Fayth bringeth vs vntoo God.</p>
            <p>Nowe when as wee knowe what the righteouſneſſe of God is, Let vs then come vnto our ſelues, and wee ſhall finde in vs nothing elſe but iniquitie: when wee ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the Wiſedome of God, we ſhall ſee that all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we thought too be good reaſon, to be nothing elſe but vanitie and follie. So then, when men doe wonder and looke at the brightneſſe of God, they then learne that they are no better but doung and filthy ſtench, are euen angry and diſpleaſed with them ſelues, and greately aſhamed of their owne filthyneſſe. See then, that humilitie proceedeth from faith. And therefore Dauid ſayth, <hi>that the proude,</hi> to witte, the wicked and Infidels <hi>imagined a lye againſt him.</hi> Let vs then knowe, that pryde is ingendred of men, and that they bringe it with them into the worlde ſo ſoone as they are borne, that it groweth and increaſeth vnto ful age, vntill ſuch time as God correcteth it by his holy ſpirit and by Fayth. And ſo when as wee ſhall ſee the contemners of God, and the wicked who knowe not what it is too be ordered by GOD, when wee ſhall ſee them, I ſay, thus outrage: let vs not think it ſtraunge, ſeeing it is the courſe of nature.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let vs well note that Dauid ſpeaking of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7694:83"/>neede which hee had of God, ſheweth vs by his example, that the more wee are vexed with temptations, that ſo much the more bolde wee ought too be, too beſeech him of his ayde, that he will reach out his hand too vpholde vs, and not to ſuffer vs to be ouercome. And this is ſpecially too be noted: for when wee are greeued with any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we knowe not that the ſame is to make vs runne too God, who is the onely remedie by which wee muſt be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
            <p>And ſo the Diuell may very eaſily enter into vs too ouerthrowe our faith, ſince it is as it were put out there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as a pray, and beſides we vouchſafe not once too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the remedy which is offered vs for our helpe. So then, let vs keepe the order which Dauid heere ſetteth downe: to witte, that if we be aſſayled with great and very ſtrong temptations, that then it is high time for vs to haue recourſe vnto God, beſeeching him to ſaue vs, and too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy our faultes, which elſe would leade vs too euerlaſting deſtruction. And thus much for this.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee haue ſoone after too note: that we ſhall make good proofe of our well willing to ſerue God, if wee reſiſt the temptations. If the wicked goe about too drawe vs vnto wickedneſſe, and yet wee ſtand faſt and ſure, then is our Fayth and conſtancy well approued. And this is ſpoken, to the ende that no man ſhoulde flatter him ſelfe, for wee thinke this to be a ſufficient excuſe, and that God ſhould alſo bee well contented therewith, too ſay, that wee were drawne to doe wickedly by the meane of ſome other. See I pray you, will euery one ſay, I was once in a very good forwardeneſſe, and deſired to liue according too the will of God. But when I ſee the worlde ſo peruerſe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and that all men were giuen to ſo many vices, it was impoſſible for mee too eſcape, but that I muſte doo as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men did. When wee ſhall alledge for our ſelues ſuch excuſes, wee thinke that God ſhoulde holde himſelfe well contented therewith.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:84"/>
            <p>But contrarywiſe, we ſee heere that the faithful neuer ceaſe for all that to ſerue God: when all the whole worlde goe about to hinder and let them: that although the wicked inuent neuer ſo many lyes, &amp; lay neuer ſo many ſtumbling blockes in their way to cauſe them too turne and decline from the right way, yet doe they ſtill ſtande firme and ſure. And ſee alſo how we muſt be faine too doe, that if wee will faithfully ſerue our good God, wee muſt not ceaſe too pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue our vocation, yea although the wicked bente all the force they were poſſibly able to make againſt vs, too turne vs cleane from the way of ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Nowe if this admonition hath beene alwaies neceſſary, it is more needefull at this day then euer it was. For wee ſee that the worlde is growne too a monſtrous heape of all iniquitie, that we are not able too ſtep foorth one ſtep, but that we ſhall meete with great ſtore of euil and daungerous incounters, which might weary and withdrawe vs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vs to doe wickedly in all kinde of thinges. Therefore we ought ſo much the rather to practiſe this doctrine, That the wicked haue imagined lyes againſt vs: but yet that wee haue kept the lawe of God. For the lyes which the proude and the enemyes of God doe imagine againſt vs, are not of one kinde. For ſometimes they wil ſeduce vs vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Friendſhip, ſometimes they will charge vs with a great many of thinges to make vs faint harted, ſometimes they will make ſuch a confuſion of all, that we ſhall not be able to diſcerne betweene white and black. We muſt then be ſo much the more well aduiſed, and ſtand the ſurer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our garde. And although the deuill tranſforme himſelfe ſo into diuerſe manners, let not vs leaue to keepe the lawe of God, yea and that with out whole hearte: which is a thing that we ought diligently to mark. For if we haue but only ſome little and feeble affection too followe God, wee ſhall ſoone be very weary thereof. Our heart therfore muſt be wholy addicted thereto, for els we ſhall neuer be able to make our parte good againſte Satan. Nowe it is ſayde a little after,</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:7694:84"/>
            <q>Their hearte is as fatte as greace: but my delight is in thy lawe.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid maketh a compariſon betweene the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of God, and thoſe which deſire to ſerue him. And why doth he ſo? He ſheweth, that the cauſe which ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Infidels too contemne GOD, is the diſſolute and brutiſhe life which they leade: becauſe they are as fatte as an Hogge in his ſtye, that hath beene fed with Accornes and Barley, and that lyeth wallowing on an heape in his owne greace. Hee is ſo very fatte and heauy that hee is not able to get vp: and although hee bee already a merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fatte and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>auy beaſt, which deſireth nothing elſe but draffe and ſwill, yet will hee bee farre fatter and heauyer, when as he ſhall be ſtyed vpp and ſo fatted. Euen ſo fareth it with theſe curſed conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of God, which haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde vnto euerlaſting life, but are wholely giuen vpp too their God the belly. They wallowe them ſelues in their owne greace, as a Swine which hath his groine alwayes in the trough. Nowe contrariwiſe Dauid ſayth, that all his delight hath beene in the woorde of God. Whereby hee doth vs to witte, that although God had made him fatte, yet that he wallowed not for all that in his owne greace, but delighted in that ſpirituall gifte which was giuen him, becauſe that God had taught it him in his Schoole.</p>
            <p>Loe then what we haue to gather out of this place: that although wee ſee the greater parte of the worlde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne God, yet muſt we not be abaſhed thereat. And why ſo? Let vs well conſider wherein men doe put their chiefe felicitie: and wee ſhall finde them too be lyke vnto Oxen, and Swine, deſiring naught but to liue heere in this world, without looking any farther. Nowe wee muſt haue a farther regarde, if we will ſerue God as too him appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to witte, that wee take ſuch pleaſure and delight in the worde of God, that wee bee no more giuen too the worlde, as we are ouermuch. And although God giueth vs aboundaunce, yet that wee haue our eaſe and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb facs="tcp:7694:85"/>in this worlde, let vs not ſettle our mindes on them, but knowe that all theſe are but pety ſmall meanes and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaryes: but let vs labour to goe too the principall, and acknowledge him too be our Father and Sauiour: And when we knowe him too be ſo, then let vs clime vpp vnto him, and too that euerlaſting life, wherevnto hee inuyteth and calleth vs. Loe I ſay, what wee haue heere too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>Moreouer if God tameth vs by affliction. Let vs come to that which Dauid addeth, to witte, <hi>That it was good for him that he had beene in trouble.</hi> Although then that God pulleth back his hand, and that in ſteade of gently intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs, hee handleth vs roughly, in ſteade of ſending vs plentie of wealth, he cauſeth vs to ſuffer hunger and thirſt, in ſteade of giuing vs health, hee greeueth vs with diſeaſes: that beeing vexed with many anguiſhes and tormentes, ſo that wee knowe not what too doe: yet muſt wee alwayes looke to the ende, to be comforted with Dauid, in ſaying, It is a good turne for mee O Lorde, that I haue beene in trouble, <hi>That I may learne thy Statutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe ſince it hath ſo fallen out, that Dauid was afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the ende he might be the better diſpoſed too learne the ordinaunces of God, what ſhall become of vs, which are full of worldely vanities? Let vs then knowe that wee had neede to be corrected by the hand of God, and to be tyed ſhort, if we will profite in the doctrine of ſaluation. Loe then, how we muſt practice the admonition of Dauid. And when we ſhall haue ſo done, we may conclude and ſay with that which is ſet downe in the laſte verſe, to wit: <hi>That the lawe of God is more deere vnto vs then Golde or Siluer.</hi> And this is it that we muſt doe in this point, wee muſt eſteeme and make much of the worde of God, as it is woorthy and not to ſtay our ſelues on the thinges of this worlde, but to looke alwayes farther off: to wit, vnto heauen. When then wee ſhall haue profited our ſelues thus by the afflictions which God ſhall ſend vs, hee will beſtowe his grace vpon vs

That it would pleaſe him not too ſuffer vs to liue heere like brute beaſtes, not knowing to what end we were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this world: but that we might acknowledge him to be our Creator, our Father and Sauiour, that wee might ſubiect our ſelues vnto him as his creatures, and obey him as true and faithfull Children, vntill ſuch time as hee ſhall take vs out of this world to make vs partakers of that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bliſſe, &amp; immortall inheritance, which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Heauen, and which is purchaſed for vs by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE ought to holde and keepe this rule and order in our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, not too meaſure his affection and loue after our own imaginations &amp; thoughts but to acknowledge him to be ſuch one as in deede he is, &amp; as he ſheweth himſelfe vnto vs to be. And loe why he ſaith by his Prophet Eſaiah, after he had de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared, that he would haue compaſſion to ſaue his church.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7694:86"/>
               <hi>Thinke not</hi> (ſayth he,) <hi>that I am like vnto you, for there is as great diſtance betweene my thoughtes and yours, as is betweene Heauen and Earth.</hi> Let vs then meaſure the goodneſſe of God after our vaine imaginations: But (as I haue already ſayd) let vs knowe that it is not in vaine, which he declareth and teſtifieth vnto vs, that the good will and loue which he beareth vs, are infinite thinges which wee muſt beholde by faith onely. And it is to the ende that we ſhould come vnto him with greater boldeneſſe too call vpon him, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but that we ſhall obtaine whatſoeuer wee craue at his hands, yea euen aſmuch as ſhall be expedient for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And according to this, Dauid heere ſetteth downe, that God had made him. As if he had ſaid, I come not vnto thee, O Lord, as we commonly come vnto men. I ſet not downe any merite or worthyneſſe, whereby I haue bounde thee vnto me: For thou art beholden nothing at all to me: but I talke of thy benefites which I haue already felte, too the ende I would haue thee to continue them vnto me. For beholde the true and very perfect nature of God: to wit, his nature is alwayes to ſpread vpon vs his graces without ceaſing: as hee is a fountaine which neuer can bee drawen dry: euen ſo muſt we not feare that he diminiſheth or leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, neither yet is ſparing of his benefites, for hee hath plentie inough to continue them without end or cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Let vs then throughly conſider this argument which Dauid heere vſeth: to wit that he telleth God that he is his Creature, to the ende he might teache him, yea euen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his law. We haue heere then to note, that Daiud putteth not in himſelfe heere, ſimply in the ranke with all the reſt of his creatures: but commeth before God, as a man faſhioned after his own image and likeneſſe: <hi>Thy hands</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>haue made me and faſhioned me:</hi> that is to ſay, Thou haſt graunted me O Lord to be an inhabiter in this world, yea, and haſt made me a reaſonable Creature. Since then it is ſo, O Lorde, that thou haſte already begun ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too intreate mee, I beſeech thee that thou wilte conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it.</p>
            <p>Nowe we ſee what a kinde or vaine of ſpeaking we muſt
<pb facs="tcp:7694:87"/>vſe, to be aſſured that God will heare our requeſtes: to wit, that we muſt lay before him his graces, which we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready receiued of him. For that ought to make vs to hope that like as hee hath begunne, ſo likewiſe will hee goe through with it, vntill ſuch time as hee hath brought his work to perfect end. Now, if we deſire god to giue vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his law, inaſmuch as he hath made vs mortal men we haue ſo much the better occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do it, in telling him that he hath adopted vs to be his children, &amp; taketh vs to be as of his houſholde. Now, when as we haue this aduantage and priuiledge, our confidence ought to be ſo much the more certain, that we ſhuld not dout but that hee would augment thoſe graces which he before had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon vs. And ſo, to the end we might profite by this place, we haue to gather briefely three poyntes: The firſte and principall which we are to wiſhe is this, that God will inſtruct vs in his lawe, that we be not ſo giuen either to the goods of this worlde, or elſe to the pleaſures of the body, and to all the reſte, but that we might alwayes haue regard to our ſpirituall health.</p>
            <p>As touching the firſt, wee are to deſire that this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may reigne in vs, to the end to keepe all the reſt in good order, which violently might carry vs away: to witte, that we ſhould deſire to be the right Scholers of God. And thus much for this. Now immediatly after followeth the meane to beſeech him, that he will beſtowe vppon vs his grace to be taught in his lawe: to wit, becauſe he hath made vs too this end, and not like vnto Oxen, Aſſes, nor Dogges, which are brute beaſtes, and nothing but corruption: but that he hath imprinted in vs his image, and ordayned vs too euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. Seeing then that he hath created vs after this manner, let vs truſt in him, and beſeech him, that hee will continue and make perfect that, which hee hath begun in vs. But we ſhall haue the greater courage too make this requeſt vnto him, when as we ſhall bee brought vnto him in the ſeconde place, that ouer and beſides that hee hath made vs men, he hath choſen vs alſo to be his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7694:87"/>made vs partakers of this diuine wiſdome, which is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Goſpell, hath ſhewed him ſelfe to be our father, and called vs into the company and fellowſhipp of his Sonne Chriſte Ieſus, that wee might bee members of his body. When as then wee may charge God with this. Loe this is a farre greater approbation of our Faith: and wee ought to beſeech him with much more certaintie and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, without doubting that it woulde pleaſe him too heare vs. And thus much for the ſeconde poynte.</p>
            <p>The third is, that although God hath taught vs, wee muſt not by and by thinke that wee are ſuch great Clarkes, and ſo well learned, as that we neede not to deſire him too confirme vs more and more in his knowledge, and too bee alwayes like vnto prentiſes &amp; yong nouices. As in very deed they which haue moſte profited, ſhoulde alwayes bee thus humbled, not to think that they had attayned to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt abundaunce of knowledge: But that they had onely ſome little taſte and ſmattering of the wiſedome of God, that they had neede too haue him to increaſe it alwayes in them more and more.</p>
            <p>Nowe if Dauid made this requeſt, yea and that in trueth knowing that he had great neede to be inſtructed of God: I pray you what arrogancie ſhall this be in vs, when as wee ſhall preſume to haue our braine ſo full ſtuffed, as that wee needed no more inſtruction? that wee ſhoulde content our ſelues with that which he had learned: ought it not to bee ſayd that we are moſt arrogaunt? And ſo, let vs after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Dauid, all the dayes of our life pray vnto God to teach vs, and that we be neuer weary of beeing taught of him, vntill ſuch time as he hath deſpoyled vs of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body: For ſo long as we ſhall remaine in this body, wee muſt needes be compaſſed aboute with blacke and thicke cloudes of ignoraunce, from which hee will then deliuer vs, through the brightneſſe of his comming. Nowe it followeth ſoone after,</p>
            <q>So they that feare thee ſhall reioyce to ſee me: becauſe I haue put my truſt in thy word.</q>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:88"/>
            <p>Dauid bringeth in heere yet another reaſon, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of his requeſt: to witte, that the faythfull will bee glad ſeeing that God hath hearde him. And this is a place greatly woorth the marking: For we are let to vnderſtand by theſe woordes, that when God beſtoweth any benefites vpon any one of our Brethren and neighboures, we ought not onely to acknowledge this goodneſſe in this acte ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but wholy apply it too our owne vſe, that it may ſerue vs for our better confirmation: that we might vnderſtand, that we ſhall be more refuſed, then he which hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obtayned his deſire. And why ſo? For God is equall and iuſt to all thoſe which call vpon him vnfaignedly. He ſayth not, that hee will doe good too one and not too an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: but we haue a generall promiſe which extendeth it ſelfe too all without exception: to witte, that if wee come vnto him for ſuccoure, and that in trueth, that hee will bee very ready to receiue vs: yea, that before we ſhall open our mouthes hee will ſtretch foorth his hand too giue vs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he knoweth to be good and profitable for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Since then that this promiſe is generall, if wee be not too too vnthankfull, we muſt needes beleeue that God will heare as aſwell as thoſe whome wee haue already ſeene him to haue hearde heeretofore: and wee muſte take their example for our better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of the promiſes which he hath made vnto vs. See heere, why Dauid ſayth, That they which feare God, ſhal ſee him, and in ſeeing him, will be glad of it: yea and wee are throughly too conſider of that which followeth: <hi>for I haue put my truſt in thy Commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dements.</hi> As if he had ſaid, They ſhal find nothing in me why thou haſte ſhewed thy ſelfe ſo louing and liberall, when as thou haſt taught te by thy holy ſpirit, but becauſe I haue put my truſt in thy word. Now thy woorde, is come too all thoſe which feare thee. So then, let them knowe that the ſame which thou haſt doone too my perſon, appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth too them alſo, and may applye it too their owne vſe. This is ſaid for a better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which I haue already ſpoken: to witte, that if God hath gently dealte
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7694:88"/>with any of our neighbours, that he hath had compaſſion vpon him: we are to conclude, that we ſhall feele him too doe the like vnto vs And why ſo? Becauſe he hath giuen vs his woorde: which is true and will neuer deceiue vs. Let vs then put our truſt in him, and we ſhall feele the like of that which wee haue ſeene in others that haue gone before vs, and ſhewed vs the way, and haue giuen vs an example too repoſe all our truſt in the goodneſſe of God, hauing the promiſes which he hath offred vs. Loe heere the meaning of Dauid in this verſe. Now it followeth,</p>
            <q>I knowe O Lord, that thy iudgementes are right: and that thou haſte afflicted me iuſtly.</q>
            <p>Dauid thinketh good to ſpeake heere a common thing, That he knoweth the ſtatutes of God to be right. For what is he that is ſo accurſed, which will confeſſe that? Yea, euen they which dare blaſpheme and ſpeake euill againſt God, when they ſhall be preſſed thus farre, yet will ſay, that the holy ſcripture is a doctrine that cannot bee amended, and that the lawe of God is the rule of all equitie. The very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked then, will ſpeake thus wel of it: but yet there are very few which haue this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration imprinted in their harts: to wit, to make this eſtimation of the lawe of God, as too ſay, that what ſoeuer is conteined therein is iuſt. And why ſo? That is firſt, by reaſon of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie that is betwene our wit and the wiſedome of God. And next, by reaſon of the contrarietie of our wicked luſtes, and affections, with the bridle which he holdeth vs, too rule vs according too his pleaſure, and in his obedience, when as men will take councell of their owne head, that they thinke to controle thereby, whatſoeuer God ſpeaketh in his woorde: wee then agree euen like fire and water. For all our wiſdome is but vanitie and leaſing, when as wee ſhall appoſe and ſet our ſelues againſte the holy Scriptures, the doctrine of the Lawe, and whatſoeuer is contayned in the Prophetes and the Goſpell. As we ſee at this day, the worlde will in no wiſe ſubiect it ſelfe thereto. From whence come all theſe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:89"/>controuerſies and diſſentions throughout al chriſtendom? Forſooth it is becauſe that men will be ouerwiſe, and will neuer honor God in ſuch ſort, as to ſay, Although O Lord our ownwittes lead vs altogither prepoſterouſly, yet muſt wee needes be ruled by thee. And becauſe that wee are not able to attaine to this reaſon, it cannot bee choſen but that the tyle ſhardes muſt needes flye about and the worlde bee infected. See then, what is the cauſe that letteth the bigger number too confeſſe bothe with hearte and mouthe, that the iudgementes of God are right: to wit, that all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wiſedome is in his lawe, in his Prophetes, and in his Goſpell: that it muſt needes fall out, that we ought to doe him homage in all this, knowing that it is impoſſible too finde any one iot therein contayned, to be amended. For although wee very well knowe, that the iudgementes of God are right, to wit, in ſuch ſorte as that our wittes and mindes might thereby be confirmed, that we might iudge it to be ſo: yet it ſo ſtandeth neuertheleſſe, that beholde our luſtes and paſſions, doe violently withſtand God, and are euer againſt him. As howe? An whoremonger ſhall be vanquiſhed that his whoredome is wicked and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A drunkarde ſhall condemne his drunkenneſſe: and ſhal neuer be able to ſay, that the vice wherevnto he is giuen is a vertue. And ſo much may bee ſayde of the ſwearer and theefe. But yet it is ſo, that ſuch kinde of people cannot giue God the glory, ſaying, that his lawe is right: For they murmure againſt him and are very angry, that they haue not the raynes of the bridle layde in their neck, and giueth them not all the lybertie that may bee too doe what them ſelues liſt. No doubt of it, if it lay in their power, they would plucke GOD out of his ſeate, that hee might haue no authoritie ouer them. Loe what mens affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are. So then, we ſhall finde a very ſmall number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be like vnto Dauid, which wil ſay in trueth and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſie, I knowe O Lorde that thy iudgementes are right. When hee ſayth, that he hath knowen, he meaneth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7694:89"/>that hee hath gotten newe vnderſtanding which hee neuer had before, as if hee had ſayde, I haue O Lorde profited ſo much, that I haue cleane giuen ouer mine owne witte and reaſon. For I knowe it to be blinde, becauſe that men will alwayes lifte vpp them ſelues aboue meaſure. But nowe O Lorde, thou haſt brought me to this poynt, that I will no longer bee gouerned by mine owne heade and fantaſie: I will not truſt to my ſelfe to knowe whether the matter ſhall be good or not, but I will reſt me on that which thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt vnto me. And thus much for the firſt poynte.</p>
            <p>And a litle after he ſayth, Although mine affections are cleane againſt thy law, that they are ready to caſt mee quite out at the Cartes arſe, as we ſay, yet for all that O Lorde, I haue bridled all my paſſions, yea and that through thy mightie power beſeeching thee to continue and hold them as pryſoners, vntill ſuch time as thou ſhakte fully haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered me from them. Loe how Dauid practiſed this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he ſayd he had of God by his worde. And let vs after his example continually recorde this leſſon: Let vs beſtowe all our ſtudy both euening and morning vpon it, to the end we may ſay that we haue knowne, that it is that, which GOD hath commaunded vs, yea too followe it. But Dauid dooth not heere ſet downe this ſimple know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the woorde of God: but goeth on farther: too witte, that God of very faythfulneſſe, <hi>had cauſed him to bee troubled.</hi> Nowe is this farre harder then the firſte.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that we ſhall haue great conflictes before wee can be able to ſubmit our ſelues to God, in ſuch humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as for to knowe &amp; ſay, that he is onely wiſe: But yet, they which knowe this, think not his chatiſements too be gentle and gratious, but are impacient, and conceiue ſome griefe, that maketh them too grinde their teeth. Nowe Dauid ioyned theſe twoo togither, to wit, that he did not onely make much of the word of God, but alſo of the puniſhment which he ſente him: as if hee had ſaide, O Lord, I do not only ſuffer my ſelf to be taught by thy word, but to bee chaſtiſed alſo with thy hand: and I beſeech thee
<pb facs="tcp:7694:90"/>to ſcourge and beate mee with thy rodes, ſo often as thou ſeeſt mee too doe amiſſe, and too cauſe mee too amende, ſhewing thy ſelfe a moſte louing and pittifull Father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes mee.</p>
            <p>Wee haue heere nowe a very good admonition: to wit, that firſt we muſt learne to be ruled after the will of God, to receiue his woorde without contradiction, that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not according as it pleaſeth our owne wittes and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, neither too make any noyſe when wee heare God ſpeake: But let him haue ſuch authoritie ouer vs, to make vs ſo ſilent, as that wee may knowe that whatſoeuer hee ſayth vnto vs is iuſte and true. And thus too doe, let vs learne not to be ſo ſleepy and ſluggiſh, as wee are by nature in our vices and ſinnes, and ſpecially in this vice of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hauing alwayes a gready deſire to be aduaunced.</p>
            <p>Let vs rather knowe that God is the Mayſter of the humble and lowely: and let vs therfore humble our ſelues, &amp; not looke ſo bigge and bee ſo fooliſh hautie, which doth nothing elſe but caſt vs hedlong into deſtruction, when as wee aduaunce our ſelues higher then becommeth vs. Let vs rather be aduiſed to bridle all our Luſtes and that which holdeth vs as it were captiues as Saint Paul ſayth. For what is the cauſe that ſo many people at this day doe ſet them ſelues againſt the Goſpell? It is not, becauſe they know not this doctrine too be good, and that they iudge not ſo of it: But yet are they not therein thorowly perſwaded too ſay, Loe howe we muſt liue: Euery man will doe whatſoeuer himſelf thinketh to be good. We muſt then needes confeſſe that the iudgements of God are right, that wee learne to holde all our paſſions in bondage: that we ſuffer our ſelues to be condemned by him, and to be rebuked for all our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and imperfections as becommeth vs. Now can we doe this? to wit, are we become ſubiect &amp; obedient to the word of God? We muſt alſo ſubmit our ſelues vnder his hand, to ſtrike vs when it ſhall pleaſe him, and liuely to vnderſtande that wee haue doone amiſſe, confeſſing that he hath iuſtly chaſtiſed vs, or as heere it is ſayde, of very faithfulneſſe.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:7694:90"/>
            <p>This is the ſumme and effect, that he is iuſt in puniſhing of vs, as he is wiſe in teaching of vs: the one ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth on the other, that is to ſay, the ſecond hangeth vpon the firſt. For whoſoeuer ſhal come to this humilitie that Dauid ſpeaketh off, to knowe, that in the worde of God there is but one holy doctrine, one infallible truth, one ſo perfect equitie, as can be no perfecter: hee that ſhall haue knowne this, ſhall by little and little haue wherewith too bee fortified too receiue the corrections with a meke ſpirite, and not to bee grieued, and to kicke againſt the pricke, as wee are wonted to doe. Let vs nowe then ſuffer God to rebuke vs, yea and to correct vs, ſeeing hee doeth all this for our profit and health. And this is the ſumme and effect of this verſe. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth next after,</p>
            <q>I praye thee that thy mercie may comfort me: according vnto thy promiſe vnto thy ſeruant.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid maketh and more generall requeſt, then that which before we haue ſeene. Hee deſireth God to inſtruct him: and now he addeth, O let thy mercifull kindnes bee my comfort. As if he had ſaid, O Lord I haue beſought thee for a ſpeciall and particular thing, but I adde nowe, that thou wilt be mercifull vnto me in all and through all, that thy mercie bee extended vpon me, that I faile in nothing. Thou knoweſt what is neceſſarie and profitable for me: O Lord let mee feele thee to bee gratious and pitifull all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes. Loe what difference there is betweene the firſt requeſt which we haue already ſeene, and this ſecond. Now this is a point worth the noting. For (as wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid) ſee the firſt which we ought to haue in a ſingular recommendation, and that is, that wee may bee taught by God, and not to be taught onely by wordes, but that hee will alſo lighten vs with his holy ſpirite, to make vs knowe, that it is his worde which guideth vs. See here, I ſay, the very right way to ſaluation. Nowe haue wee made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt? we may craue of God that hee will not let vs fall in anything whatſoeuer, that his mercy may comfort vs. But yet here we ſe how that Dauid was not comforted nor yet
<pb facs="tcp:7694:91"/>reioyced but onely in God, knowing that all the ioye that we haue here bilowe ſhalbe accurſed, when as wee haue no regarde vnto our Creator. And yet for all this, ſe how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wee are wonted to reioyce and comfort our ſelues, that is, euen to forget God, &amp; to turne our backs vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Now accurſed be ſuch ioy, for the iſſue thereof can be none other, but as our Lord Chriſt Ieſus ſayeth, That it ſhall bee turned into weeping and gnaſſhing of teeth. Howbeit, the worlde is waxen dronke, for whatſoeuer is ſaide vnto it, it maketh no reckoning thereof, but vtterly refuſeth al good &amp; ſound doctrine. In deede this is true, that this ſame was not written in vaine: but that we ſhalbe ſo much the more inexcuſable, when as we ſhall haue the example of Dauid, except we folowe it. See then for this firſt point, that after Dauid had compaſſed the whole worlde both aboue and beneath, he founde no reſt to comfort his ſpirite and ſoule, but at ſuch time as he made his repaire vnto God. And there I ſay, he found wherwith to reioyce and comfort him ſelfe: finding nothing els but vnquietneſſe in all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Now he ſoone after ſetteth downe, how we ought to reioyce and to be comforted in God: to wit, through his mercie: for if God ſhoulde deale with vs according to our deſertes, we ſhould haue no cauſe wherefore to reioyce, but rather be confounded with very horrour and feare. When as God ſhal declare him ſelf to be our iudge, alas, which way ſhall wee be able to turne vs? Muſt wee not needes bee caſt headlong into the deepe pit? If it be ſaid that wee muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the maieſtie of our God, what ſhall become of vs which ſucke vp iniquitie euen as the fiſhe ſucketh in water, as it is written in the booke of Iob? Wherefore, let vs know that if we will rightly reioyce, and finde ſure reſt in our conſciences, wee muſt betake our ſelues to this free mercie of our God, that he declareth him ſelfe pitifull vnto vs in that he ſeeth vs to be miſerable &amp; wretched creatures, and to put foorth our hand vnto him to receiue his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Nowe Dauid in the ende ſheweth whereuppon he buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7694:91"/>him ſelfe, in making ſuch a requeſt:</p>
            <q>According vnto thy worde, made vnto thy ſeruant.</q>
            <p>Loe whereupon we muſt builde and ſettle our ſelues, when as we will come vnto God, to be heard of him to wit, vpon his meere mercie, as we haue here aboue ſaid. But are wee already come thus farrefurth? And if wee be, yet is there an other point farther required: to wit, wee muſt aſsure our ſelues that the graces of God ſhall adorne and garniſhe vs, ſo we ſeeke them according to his word. And to proue it to be ſo, marke I beſeeche you, for it were marueilous great preſumption in vs, to come vnto God, without we had his promiſes for it, and to deſire of him any thing, and ſay, O Lord, I haue neede of this and that. Go to now, here is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſome occaſion which cauſeth vs to come vnto God. And againe, O Lord, thou art good and gracious: loe this is an other thing alſo which augmenteth our courage and boldnes. But bicauſe we are ſo farre from God, that we are not able to come nere his maieſtie, without he come down vnto vs: we muſt then, before wee can haue any acceſſe to make our prayers vnto him, lay this foundation which is here ſet before vs: that is to ſay, the word of God, when as thereby God witneſſeth vnto vs, that his mercie is alwayes readie, that he there laieth it before vs, and offereth the ſame there vnto vs. There remaineth now nothing els, but that wee receiue it by faith, and that there wee declare our faith through our calling vpon him. So then we ſee, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Dauid here ſetteth downe, that is, that hee brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs to God, to the ende we might take our whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, repoſe, and reioyſing in his meere goodneſſe. And ſince, that he hath receiued vs through his mercie, let vs beſeeche him that he would looke vnto vs with his eyes of pitie. For the third point, he ſheweth vs how we ought to make ſuch our petitions, that is, bicauſe God hath bounde him ſelfe vnto vs of his own good will, and hath witneſſed vnto vs that he wil be neare vs. When then we ſhal come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in this ſort, let vs not doubt but that he wil heare vs &amp; graunt whatſoeuer we ſhall deſire according to his will.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:92"/>
            <p>And namely he ſayeth, thy woorde made vnto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, to thende he would declare to euery of vs that euery man ſhould apply the promiſes of God particularly vnto him ſelfe. And not to vſe the maner of the Papiſtes, to ſaye. It is very true that God hath promiſed this and that, but we know not whether the ſame belongeth vnto vs or not. And theſe are no fooles, which ſay thus, but this is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they teache in all their Satanicall and deueliſh Schooles and Synagogues. Loe here the very doctrine of popiſh doctors, that the promiſe of God are vncertaine, &amp; that we muſt receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as things hanging in the ayre, not to take them generally, to ſay, I doubt not but that GOD ſpeaketh the ſame vnto me. But contrariwiſe, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as Dauid here doth, and O Lord let it be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſeruant according to thy word. He ſaith not, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy word, I knowe not to whom, nor vnto ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which number I am not, ſo that I can not builde vppon it: but he ſaith, according to thy promiſe O Lord, made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Let vs then learne by his example, that when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lord God to aſsiſte vs, to charge him with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yea &amp; let vs apply them vnto our ſelues, and beleeue that they are alſo ſpoken to euery of vs in particular, and generally vnto all: I meane vnto all the faithfull. When as the Lord our God ſaieth, I receiue all ſinners to mercy: let euery one ſaye, O Lorde, I am one of thoſe miſerable and wretched creatures, and therefore I come vnto thee, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thee with thy promiſe made vnto me. Loe howe wee muſt behaue our ſelues herein: for els, we ſhall but wander in the holy ſcripture all the daies of our life. It followeth immediatly after,</p>
            <q>Let thy tender mercies come vnto me that I may liue: for thy lawe is my delight.</q>
            <p>In this verſe we may very well ſee, that Dauid was as it were eſtranged from the mercie of God. Now this is a very notable point to be conſidered off: for what is the cauſe of our diſtruſt, yea euen to cloſe vp the gate againſt God for that we would not come vnto him, but onely bicauſe wee
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7694:92"/>thinke that God hath eſtraunged him ſelfe from vs, and that we ſhould be thereby confounded. It is very true that he will ſometimes cauſe vs to feele them, as if he had cleane turned him ſelfe away from vs, and all bicauſe we firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke him: but yet we muſt notwithſtanding returne vnto him, and not be diſcouraged, but followe the example of Dauid, that although the mercies of God to the outwarde apparance and in our iudgement bee farre from vs, and in ſuch ſort, as that we may well perceiue it: yet muſt we neuer ceaſe to ſay, O Lord, let thy louing mercies come vnto me: ſurely to the outrward ſhew, &amp; ſo farre as I can iudge, they are farre of me: but yet O Lorde, I knowe that thou wilt in the ende make me to attaine vnto them: yea and although thou manifeſtly ſheweſt me them not, yet notwithſtanding I will wayte and ſurely looke for them, with an aſſured faith and hope. Moreouer, when he ſayeth, that I may liue: that is to ſignifie vnto vs the ſame which I haue already ſaid: to wit, that although his wit and ſpirite, ſtayed it ſelfe vpon creatures, yet that he was but as a dead man, &amp; whiles he thought God not to be neare him, hee ſuppoſed him ſelf to be but as a forlorne man. And in deede although we had all the world on our ſide, and had GOD againſt vs, and were ſure that he neither loued nor fauoured vs, all the reſt would turne but to our ruyne and deſtruction. And if wee eſteeme not thus of him, muſt it not needes be but that we muſt bee bewitched by Satan, and caried violently away, when we ſhall content vs onely with theſe worldly things, and neuer haue regard vnto the ſpring head and fountaine of all goodneſſe: to wit, the bounty of God? But in the meane while let vs note this, that although we bee dead for a time, after the example of Dauid, yet ſhall wee be quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo that we come to God, beſeeching him not to holde backe his mercies farre from vs. Now he ſaieth in the ende, <hi>For thy lawe is my delight.</hi> By this we are admoniſhed what it is that we muſt craue at the handes of God in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, forſooth that his mercies may remaine with vs: to wit, when as we are conformable to him and to his woorde.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:93"/>
            <p>Let it not now abaſh vs although wee feele ſo little taſte of God his mercies. And why ſo? For what is he that will acknowledge it? Wee are ſo beguiled with theſe falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes of the worlde, that we thinke we may triumphe by them, that wee ſhall bee exceedingly bleſſed when as wee ſhall haue all thinges after our owne heartes deſire. But in thus doing we can contemne God and his grace. We muſt not then be abaſhed if we be ſet beſides that which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth to our ſaluation, and that God ſuffereth vs to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe in wretchedneſſe and miſerie. And ſo let vs learne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of Dauid, to bee as it were reiected of the worde of God, and to bee as it were eſtraunged from it to craue in good earneſt, to cauſe his mercies to retourne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: to wit, that he would graunt vs this grace, to let vs in ſuch ſort vnderſtand what neede we haue of his fauour and aide, that notwithſtanding that we haue declined from his commandements, yet that he would graunt vs for all that, to feele his mercie, although he hath held the ſame from vs for a ſeaſon. Now it followeth,</p>
            <q>Let the proude be confounded, for they haue delt wickedly and falſely with me: but I meditate in thy commaundementes.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid ſetteth downe another reaſon, to confirme him ſelf continually more and more, that hee ſhall obtaine that which he praieth vnto God for: to wit, bicauſe the wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked do perſecute him: whom he calleth the proud. And this is the ſentence which wee haue already heretofore treated off, neither will the time ſuffer vs to ſtay any lenger vpon it. It ſhall therefore ſuffice vs for this time, that faith onely is the thing which bringeth vs within the compaſſe of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, when as we know that there is nothing in vs but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and that wee are thereto tied, by the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God. When I ſay, that the faithfull knowe this, it pulleth downe their high mindes, they are no more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant nor preſumptious, to lifte themſelues vp againſt God, and their neighbours. Contrariwyſe the wicked and enemies of GOD are called proude: for the pride which they vſe againſt GOD, engendreth alſo crueltie againſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7694:93"/>their neighbours.</p>
            <p>As many as will humble them ſelues before God, will alſo bee very gentle too their neighbours: but they which haue a fierſe and high mynde to ſtande againſt God, muſt needes likewiſe caſt their poyſon againſt their neighbours. And for this cauſe Dauid ſayeth, let the proud O Lord be confounded, for they go wickedly about to confound me. Whereby wee are admoniſhed, that although the wicked vexe and grieue vs neuer ſo iniuriouſly and without cauſe, yet we are thereby taught to haue the rather a great deale more truſt that God wil haue mercie vpon vs. And why ſo? bicauſe it is he which graunteth our requeſt: and when as we ſhall make it vnto him, it ſhall not come of our ſelues, but he ſhalbe authour thereof. So then, when as we ſhall be grieued and iniuried by malitious and cruell men, let vs go boldly vnto God, and beſeeche him to haue pitie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion vpon vs. Nowe he addeth, that he neuer ceaſed to meditate vpon the teſtimonies of God, although he was ſo afflicted. And this is an excellent admonition for vs, that when wee are tormented both from heauen, and on the earth, that God on the one ſide, to the outwarde ſhewe, eſtraungeth him ſelfe from vs: and we on the other ſide are ſo forſaken, that wee are troden vnder mens feete, beſides a thouſand other villaines done vnto vs: when as, I ſay, wee ſhall be ſo vexed and grieued. We muſt learne after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Dauid to meditate of the teſtimonies of God, and there to ſeeke our whole comfort, for that is the very meane by which God meaneth to plucke vs out of all our anguiſhes and griefes which might any way trouble vs.</p>
            <p>That now which foloweth, hath beene already handled: to wit, that men which feare God doe turne vnto him: to ſay, that they will keepe him companie. And in the ende he ſetteth downe this concluſion:</p>
            <q>Let my heart bee vpright in thy ſtatutes: that I bee not aſhamed.</q>
            <p>Now like as in the firſt verſe hee deſireth GOD to giue him vnderſtanding that hee might learne his Lawe, here

            <p>And thus much for the firſt point. But yet vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding onely ſhall not ſerue. God muſt make our heartes pliant vnto his obedience, and place vs ſo with him ſelfe, as that we haue none other deſire but to ſerue him. Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learne to pray vnto him as Dauid here hath done: for after he had deſired him to giue him vnderſtanding of his law, he deſireth him alſo to giue him a pure and a ſound heart: yea and that we ſhould alſo doe the ſame in veritie &amp; truth, not doubting but that when God hath beſtowed vpon vs ſome graces, that he will alſo encreaſe them more &amp; more, and haue compaſsion vpon vs, ſo that we be obedient vnto him in our behalfe, and yelde him the homage and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which vnto him belongeth.</p>
            <p>And according vnto this doctrine, let vs in all humilitie proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging our offences, beſeeching him ſo to touch vs, as that wee might learne after the example of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, how to make and preſent our requeſtes vnto him, &amp; to bereaue vs of all our earthly affections, which we feele to be moſt violent againſt vs, to the ende that our minde bee not withdrawne through them from his righteouſnes, but that wee ſubmit our ſelues wholy vnto his holy will, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing els but to haue him to gouerne vs: to the end that being fortified by his holy ſpirite, we might perſeuere vnto the end to reſiſt thoſe temptations which ſhal grieue vs, to obteine the victory aboueſaid, and come to the triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe which is prepared for vs in heauen aboue.

               <pb facs="tcp:7694:97"/>ſeeming, we had long before very well vnderſtand and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Now we ſhould not at the leaſt be forgetfull of them, when neede requireth, yea, and that when wee are thereby enforced. And for that cauſe wee haue here a very excellent leſſon for the purpoſe, &amp; worthy the noting: for Dauid doth not only teach vs as a Prophet of God, what our dutie is, &amp; what the power and vertue of our faith ought too bee: but ſheweth vs alſo the way by his example, howe wee muſt bee pacient in all our aduerſities, and howe we ought not to fal from that: to wit, that we alwayes haue our eye fixed vpon the promiſes of God. For that ſhal be enough to entertaine and keepe vs, in ſuch ſort as that we ſhould paciently waite for his ſauing health, yea, euen in calling vpon him. But that we might the better profite by this doctrine, wee are here to note, that the twoo firſt verſes are both of one and ſelfe-ſame ſubſtance, ſaue that the order of the wordes are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Hee ſaieth in the firſt place, <hi>My ſoule fainteth for thy ſaluation,</hi> That is to ſay, O Lorde, I haue longed, albeit the afflictions and miſeries which I haue abidden, were very great: and laſted long, and that I ſee neither ende nor iſſue of them, yet neuertheleſſe I reſted altogether hereon, that I alwayes truſted, that thou wouldeſt bee my ſupporter and aider. Nowe hee addeth the reaſon howe hee coulde ſo faint: to wit, bicauſe he truſted vnto the promiſes of God. In the ſecond verſe he ſaieth, <hi>That he hath failed for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, yea euen looking for this promiſse,</hi> and that he hath ſaid, <hi>When wilt thou comfort me?</hi> And in the third he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that which before hee had ſpoken of: to wit, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had beeene as it were parched and dried, <hi>euen as a ſkinne bottle in the ſmoke,</hi> ſo that there remained neither moyſture nor ſubſtance in him but dried vp with verie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, <hi>yet that he had not forgotten the teſtimonies of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee then nowe what the ſumme and effect of this is, which is here ſhewed vnto vs: to wit, that there is but one onely meane too cauſe vs to bee conſtant and pacient, when as we are afflicted, and that our aduerſities doe euer long laſt as wee imagine: that is, too bee mindefull of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7694:97"/>promiſes of God, and to haue them depely imprinted in our hartes. For if that bee ſo, it wil not coſt vs much to be patient: and although it bee an harde matter, yet wee ſhall at the laſt come too the ende of it. Let vs then now marke, from whence our impatience ſpringeth, and what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is why wee are ſo oftentimes ouercome with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: or elſe, when as wee ſhal haue for a tyme reſiſted them, yet in the ende wee are confounded and faintharted. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is bicauſe wee forget the teſtimonies of GOD, and turne away from his woorde. In very deede, this at the firſt ſight may ſeeme too bee a common matter with vs. And to ſay the truthe, euery man wil ſay, that we ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, and that it is the onely remedy too comforte vs. But wee ſhal the oftener doo it, when as wee ſhal haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this leſſon which is heere ſet downe vntoo vs, and that wee recorde it al the dayes of our life: For this is one of the principalleſt pointes that is too bee required in al Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that when they perceiue that God hath laide his hand on them, that they bee as it were almoſt caſt downe: yet that they might comfort themſelues, in ſtaying of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſaluation which God hath promiſed them. But yet, let vs throughly conſider the worde which Dauid here vſeth: <hi>I haue longed</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>after the ſaluation, and I haue hoped,</hi> or after that I had hoped, <hi>bicauſe of thy woorde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeconde parte of this verſe, is as it were the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation whereon Dauid buildeth. Let vs vnderſtande then this hope which wee ought to haue in the worde of God, as Dauid had: for without that, it is impoſsible but that wee muſt bee confounded. for although it ſeeme in the iudgement of menne, that there is in vs ſome vertue and ſoundneſſe too indure and ſuffer patiently, yet ſhal it not be ſuch a true patience as GOD alloweth. And why ſo? For wee ſhal neuer beare him that affection too obey him, without wee comforte our ſelues that hee loueth vs, and that we truſt to his bountie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:98"/>
            <p>A man, I ſay, ſhall neuer be diſpoſed to obey God, and to glorifie him in afflictions, except hee haue a taſte of the bountie, and fatherly loue, which he beareth vs. Now how can it be that wee ſhould bee fully perſuaded that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs, and procureth our wealth and health, when as he afflicteth vs, without we be armed with his promiſes? For it is impoſsible for vs to knowe the truth of God, except he declare the ſame vnto vs in his word. Let vs learne then, as I haue already ſaid, that the pacience of the faithfull can not be built, but vpon faith and hope in the promiſes of God. Loe then what we haue to note in this place.</p>
            <p>Now Dauid hauing laid ſuch a foundation, buildeth thereon, ſaying, that his ſoule longed after the ſaluation of God: when he ſaieth that his ſoule longed, he meaneth not that he was ſo forlorne, as that hee had in the ende giuen him cleane ouer: ne yet that Satan had gotten any aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of him: but that worde, <hi>to long,</hi> is taken in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that which notwithſtanding is conioyned with ſuch obedience as we ought to yelde vnto God, ſtaying and ſetling our ſelues vpon him. As howe? Saint Paul ſayeth, <hi>That we ought to hope beyond all hope as Abraham did:</hi> to wit, we muſt ſurmount all our wittes and imaginations, when there is any queſtion of our beliefe in God. For if wee will meaſure the promiſes of God by our owne wittes, what ſhall become of it? our faith then muſt exceede and goe beyond all the wiſedome of men, as here it is ſayde, <hi>That his ſoule hath longed:</hi> which is as much as if Dauid had ſaid, it is true O Lorde, that according to mans reaſon, I was vtterly forlorne: yea I was ſo oppreſſed with miſeries, as that I could beare no moe: but when I was in the middes of death, I ceaſed not for all that vntill I was arriued at a ſure hauen: to wit, thy ayde and helpe. Now he namely ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Gods ſuccour, bicauſe it ſhall goe very hard, but that we wil wander, looke aboue, and beneath, both before and behinde, to ſee if wee can finde readie helpe.</p>
            <p>But if the trouble laſt long &amp; we ſee not which way to get
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7694:98"/>out of it, but that it is like a bottomles pitte: although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſomewhat truſted and hoped vpon God, yet for all that wee ſhall then bee driuen and egged, to ſeeke for aide here and there, we know not where. And howe ſo? Is it not poſsible for me to finde remedie? Bicauſe, I ſaye, wee are ſo dull, and the hope which we haue in God, paſſeth ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away from vs, and melteth, and runneth about, this way and that way: Dauid for this reaſon ſayeth, <hi>That hee hoped for the ſaluation of God.</hi> Hereby then hee ſheweth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this occaſion was offered him to ſeeke after other helpes, and to caſt his eyes vppon creatures, and to forſake God: yet that the temptations had not ſo wonne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him but that he alwayes remained conſtant in this reſolution, that it was God which muſt relieue his neede. Nowe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he addeth,</p>
            <q>Mine eyes faile for thy promiſe, ſaying: when wilt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me?</q>
            <p>I haue abready ſaid that this verſe conteineth no new or ſtrange thing, but Dauid chaungeth onely the order of the wordes. For when he ſaieth, <hi>That his eyes ſore longed after the word of God,</hi> he meaneth none other thing but this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all his wittes were troubled, and that hee was as it were blinded with the multitude of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, yet that hee alwayes ſtayed him ſelfe vppon this word of God, and neuer ceaſed calling vpon him, ſaying: <hi>O when wilt thou comfort me?</hi> By this hee ſheweth vs, that if we haue a true faith ſetled vppon the promiſes of GOD made vnto vs, when as it ſhall pleaſe him ſoone after to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict vs, we muſt not by and by bee angry, biting the bit as Mules do: but let vs yelde him true obedience, ſaying: <hi>O Lord, when wilt thou comfort me?</hi> Wee muſt then ſuffer and abide thus to do: to wit, that when we beſeech and require God, to helpe vs according to his promiſe, wee muſt alſo deſire him, to ſhewe it vs by the effect: and wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine firme and conſtant, vntill ſuch time as he cauſeth vs to perceiue it: for although hee delayeth his aide, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it as it were in ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yet muſt we be fully perſuaded
<pb facs="tcp:7694:99"/>that he hath not forgotten his office, which is, to comfort vs. By this meane we ſhall finde in the ende the fruite of our prayers. Nowe he fully and wholy explaneth in the third verſe following, when as hee ſheweth it to be no ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be thus caſt downe, had not the woorde of God ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained, and vpheld him, but that there was great reaſon in it. I am, ſaith he, like vnto a Goates ſkinne wherein oyle, or wyne is put, hanging in the ſmoke, and ſo dried and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as that there was neither ſubſtance nor moiſture left in him. Dauid vſeth this ſimilitude, to ſhewe that his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were ſo great and exceſsiue, as that hee was without all ſtrength, and without hope of life. Now he addeth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>That he did not, yet forget the ſtatutes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loe an example which wee ought too followe, neither muſt we alledge here our infirmitie: for Dauid was a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate man as we are: he might very well haue fainted, if God had not ſtrengthened him. And how ſo? Hauing the promiſes, he hoped vpon them: knowing that God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth his benefites towardes his children, bicauſe they ſhould haue recourſe vnto him: hee called vpon him, for that hee had already founde mercie and ſuccour of him: God ſo holpe him through his holy ſpirite. Nowe, haue not wee at this daye the ſame promiſes which Dauid had? Yea, haue wee not more large and ample promiſes? Haue not wee &amp; great deale more familiar acceſſe then Dauid had, bicauſe that Ieſus Chriſte is declared too bee a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour more manifeſtly, then he was vnder the lawe? When God then rendreth vs ſuch a teſtimonie of his good will, that wee may freely come before him to praye vnto him, to the ende hee might helpe our neceſsities: I praye you what excuſe ſhall wee make, if wee come not boldely vnto him as Dauid did, and be conſtant to perſeuere in the ſame purpoſe, ſeeing that God offereth the ſelfe ſame meanes, to fight againſt whatſoeuer may turne vs awaye from it. Moreouer, is the power of God leſſened ſince that time? Doth he not at this day helpe all his faithfull with his holy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7694:99"/>ſpirite, as he did vnder the lawe. Yea, doth not he ſaye that he will encreaſe the kingdome of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, more then euer he did at that time?</p>
            <p>There is nothing then but our vnthankefulneſſe which hath ſhut the gate againſt God, ſo that his graces can haue no acceſſe nor entraunce into vs. It is very true, that he will ſay enough vnto vs, but we will ſtope our eares: he wil make vs fayre promiſe enough, but we will ſoone forget them: or els if we keepe them in minde, it ſhalbe but a raunging imagination, neither ſhall it haue any deepe print, or yet liuely roote in vs. Bicauſe therefore, that wee eſteeme not of the promiſes of God, loe the reaſon why wee are ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly caſt downe, euen with the leaſt temptation that may come. Howe exerciſe we our faith in prayers? what readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and zeale is there at this daye amongſt Chriſtians in calling vpon the name of God? Alas it is ſo colde and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it can not be more. And ſo ſee why God hath pluckt backe his hand from vs, bicauſe of our infidelitie, ſo that we feele not his helpe as we ſhould. The more depely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought we to conſider of this ſentence here, when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid declareth <hi>that he was cleane dried vp, and yet for all that forgot not the promiſes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs now goe and vaunt our ſelues to bee good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that we haue greatly profited in the Goſpel, and yet when as wee ſhalbe touched with any little, yea, and that with a very light affliction, wee ſhall bee ſo amaſed as it is woonder. Alas what ſhould become of vs, if wee ſhould be as Dauid proteſteth hee was? that God threatned vs through ſtitche, that there were but one droppe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of life, and that it ſhould ſeeme that we were euen as it were dead. If then there were ſuch a kinde of parched dryneſſe in vs, what ſhould become of it? But what? here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reſteth the faulte, that euery man flattereth him ſelfe, and wee alſo thinke that GOD ſhoulde ſubmitte him ſelfe to our flatteries,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:100"/>
            <p>But it is not in vaine that this example is here ſet before vs. Let vs exerciſe our ſelues then better then we haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore done, and call to minde the teſtimonies of God. When as we ſhal bee parched, and ſo dried, as that it might ſeeme wee had not one droppe of life? let vs notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, meditate yet more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer before we did of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, to the ende we might get vs newe force and ſtrength. Now when Dauid had thus ſpoken, he addeth,</p>
            <q>
               <p>How many are the daies of thy ſeruant? when wilt thou be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of them that perſecute me?</p>
               <p>The proud haue digged pittes for me: which are not after thy lawe.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here Dauid purſuing his purpoſe maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the griefes which he endured, that is, the wicked and vngodly perſecuted him wrongfull, and that hee beeing retired to God, as to his ſaulfegarde, found no ſuccour of him at the firſt daſh, but that God held him at a bay, as a forlorne ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now herevpon hee rightly ſheweth that his faith was not clerely quenched, ne yet leſſened: but that he ſtil continued in prayer. And in the ende concludeth, that he will yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remember the word of God, when as he ſhall bee ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by him, and raiſed vp againe as it were from death. Let vs then note, that Dauid here ſetteth downe a certaine maner and order to ſhewe vs, that when God, to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhewe ſhall ſeeme to eſtraunge him ſelfe, yet we muſt take hede that the ſame keepe vs not from hauing recourſe vnto him. Now it may very wel ſeeme, that God ſometimes thinketh not of vs, but ſpecially, when hee ſhall ſuffer the wicked to runne whether they lift, and let them doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they deſire.</p>
            <p>Now this is a terrible temptation. And why? For on the one ſide we looke that if God tooke vs for his children, &amp; loued vs as he teſtifieth, ſhould he not by and by haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion of our miſeries? ſhould he not put forth his hande to helpe vs? When then he ſuffereth vs to be thus vniuſtly troden vnder foote, it is a ſigne that hee hath forſaken vs, and that he hath no care of vs, nor of our health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:7694:100"/>
            <p>Loe heere a very hard and greeuous temptation. And the ſecond is, that it ſhould ſeeme that God doth not his office, How is that? Beholde how the vngodly fall out with him ſo that it ſeemeth they would giue him open defiaunce. For is not this to make warre againſt him, when as they giue them ſelues licence to doe wickedly: that whatſoeuer can beſayd vnto them, they can neuer bee brought too good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? And yet God maketh ſemblaunce as though he had no care of their wicked dealing. Theſe we ſee are two mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous daungerous temptations. And this is the cauſe namely why Dauid hath heere recited his perſecutions, which he abode at the handes of the wicked.</p>
            <p>Now it is ſo, that he beeing in ſuch conflictes, hauing to fight againſt theſe two temptations, which I haue noted, ſheweth right wel that he remained ſtil conqueror. And ſee why he ſayth, <hi>How many are the dayes of thy ſeruant? when wilt thou be auenged of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that perſecute me?</hi> Dauid ſignifieth that he made not this requeſt vntill ſuch time as hee was driuen too this extremitie, that he was no longer able to abide it. As if he ſhould haue ſayde, Alas, my good God, wilte thou helpe me after I am deade? For thou ſeeſt that I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy abidden ſo much, as it is not poſſible to indure more: thou ſeeſt me euen at the graues brinke: It is now time, or elſe neuer to helpe. But yet I perceiue no ſuccour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from thee. And what is the cauſe? When wilte thou doe it? It cannot bee choſen but that Dauid had as it were an intollerable affliction, when he called vpon God in this manner. Wherefore we are ſo much the rather to meditate on this place. For although God ſuffereth vs to be afflicted but for a little while: yet the ſame laſteth ſo with vs, as that we beeing vexed euen to the vttermoſte, will ſay, I knowe not where I am, nor what to doe heerein. What is the cauſe why God deferreth his ayde ſo long? For in ſteade too call vpon him, it is out of doubt rather that we murmure, yea and moyte as it were ſecretly againſt him. Nowe the right remedy to ouercome theſe temptations, &amp; not ſo to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt God in our afflictions, is this, to call vpon him
<pb facs="tcp:7694:101"/>with full aſſuraunce, beſeeching him to graunt vs his grace, that notwithſtanding al the afflictions which he layeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, yet that he leaue vs not for all that too hope after that which hee hath promiſed vs. And this is it which Dauid declareth yet more fully, when after he had ſayde, that the vngodly had gone aboute to digge pittes for him, which is not after his lawe, hee addeth, and ſayth,</p>
            <q>All thy Commaundements are true: they perſecute me falſely, be thou my helpe.</q>
            <p>Heere he expreſſeth what the iniuryes &amp; outrages were which they had done him, <hi>They haue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>digged pittes for mee,</hi> yea and he proteſteth that they did it vniuſtly, that he neuer gaue the wicked occaſion to hurt him: but that he had walked in a good and pure conſcience. Yet ſaith hee, <hi>They haue gone about to circumuent and compaſſe mee rounde about.</hi> Wee ſee then that Dauid had no ſmall aſſaultes, but ſuch as were euen deadly, that it was without all queſtion that he muſt be vtterly confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: yea &amp; although he neuer hurt any of them, that it might be ſayd, that he had iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perſecuted them, yet had he alwayes his recourſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. So then, we may now bee better confirmed in the doctrine which we haue heeretofore handled: to wit, that to whatſoeuer extremititie we are driuen vnto in our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, we ſhall bring them to a very good end, when as we being fenced with the power of the ſpirit of God, do looke vnto his promiſſes. Now let vs ſee why he addeth and ſayth, <hi>Thy Commaundementes are true, they perſecute me falſely, O help me.</hi> Dauid ſetteth downe heere three poyntes, The one is that God is true: &amp; after he addeth a proteſtation of his good conduct and guydance, and of the malice of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaryes: Thirdly, he calleth vppon God in his afflictions. Now as concerning the firſt, hee ſheweth vs, that although Satan to ſhake vs, and in the ende vtterly too carry vs away ſubtilly and cunningly goeth about to deceiue vs, we muſt, to the contrary, learne how to knowe his ambuſhes, and to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7694:101"/>keepe vs from out of them. So often then as wee are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with aduerſitie and affliction, where muſt we beginne? See Satan howe he pitcheth his nettes, and layeth his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes to induce and perſwade vs to come into them, what ſayth he, dooſt thou not ſee thy ſelfe forſaken of thy God? where are the promiſes wherevnto thou diddeſt truſt? Now heere thou ſeeſt thy ſelf to be a wretched forlorne creature. So then, thou right well ſeeſt that God hath deceiued thee, and that the promiſes wherevnto thou truſtedſt, appertaine nothing at all vnto thee. See heere the ſubtlety of Satan. What is nowe to be doone? We are to conclude with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and ſaye, yet God is true and faithfull. Let vs I ſay keepe in minde the trueth of God as a ſheelde too beate back whatſoeuer Satan is able to lay vnto our charge, when as he ſhall goe about to cauſe vs to deny our Fayth, when as alſo he ſhall lye about vs too make vs beleeue that God thinketh no more of vs, or elſe, that it is in vaine for vs too truſt vnto his promiſes. But let vs knowe cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it is very plaine and ſounde trueth which GOD ſayth vnto vs. Although Satan caſteth at vs neuer ſo many dartes, although he haue neuer ſo exceeding many deuiſes againſt vs, although nowe and then by violenve, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with ſubtiltie and cunning, it ſeemeth in very deede too vs, that he ſhould ouercome vs: Neuertheleſſe, he ſhall neuer bring it to paſſe, but that wee ſhall haue the trueth of God, to be ſure and certaine in our heartes. And thus much for the firſt.</p>
            <p>The proteſtation which Dauid maketh, ought too ſtirre vs vpp too walke in ſuch ſorte with our neighboures, as that wee giue them no occaſion too hurte vs. But too liue plainely and ſimply one by an other. The wicked may very well hurte one another, yea and euen deſtroy them ſelues: but in the meane time, the Children of God muſte haue this teſtimony alwayes with them, that they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe nor yet procure them any hurte: but are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ſorrowfull too ſee them runne headlong into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:102"/>
            <p>When this mind ſhalbe in vs, then ſhal we haue an excellent entraunce to call vpon God: but contrariwiſe, if we render euill for euill, beeing moleſted by our enemyes, and inforce our ſelues to doo the like, and cry quittance (as we ſay) with them, our cauſe wil quite bee ouerthrowne. And why ſo? For if we ſhall be ſo vengefull, it is impoſſible for vs to truſt and beleeue that God wil helpe vs. Yea euen then I ſay, when we ſhall haue a good and iuſt quarrell. For God will diſcharge vs if wee ſhall not haue a good conſcience: and although ſome there, are which would both wiſh and doe vs hurt: We muſt ſay, O Lord, this is iniuriouſly and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doone. But (as I haue already touched) let vs haue ſuch a teſtimonie in our heartes, that although they which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute vs are the inſtrumentes and limmes of Satan, and do it of meere malice: Let vs not cleane contrary purchaſe them any hurte or diſpleaſure. Then may wee call vppon God with Dauid, knowing that hee will neuer faile thoſe which are wrongfully perſecuted. Loe then the meaning of theſe three poyntes which are heere touched. Now after that Dauid had thus ſpoken, he addeth,</p>
            <q>They had almoſt made an ende of me vpon the Earth: But I forſake not thy comaundements.</q>
            <p>See heere a ſentence worthy to bee well weyed. It is very true that Dauid expreſſeth that which he had before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>I haue not</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>forſaken thy commaundementes O Lord, although I was as one clearely dryed vp, and as a man vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forlorne, yet for all that haue I not forſaken thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes.</hi> Nowe it muſt needes be that Dauid reſiſted two temptations in continuing ſo firme and conſtant in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of God. The firſt was, that he might haue beene brought into ſome diſtreſſe. The ſecond, that he might haue bin bent to haue done wickedly. And why ſo? ſeing that the wicked had vniuſtly perſecuted him, hee might haue beene reuenged of them. Loe the two aſſaultes which was meete and conuenient for him to ſuſtaine and keepe of. Euen ſo muſt we followe his example: For when men ſhall vniuſtly moleſt and greeue vs, and that they ſhall not onely doe vs
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7694:102"/>one iniury, yea two or three: but that our trouble ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without ende and without ceaſing, let vs yet learne to be pacient. And chiefely, when as there ſhall be no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of abiding a little damage, or ſmall greefe: But that we ſhall be mortally perſecuted, and our life too be as it were deſperate, to be already as it were in the very throte of the Woulfe, yea to bee already euen as men ſwallowed vp and deuoured. When as we ſhalbe brought euen to ſuch a paſſe, yet let vs not ceaſe to ſay with Dauid, <hi>I haue not forſaken thy commaundements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo that wee might the better practiſe this doctrine, and apply it to our owne vſe and profite, let vs learne too haue recourſe vnto God in all our afflictions, calling vpon him to be our warraunt and ſafegarde. And in the meane while, although we be wrongfully moleſted, let vs beſeech him to graunt vs his grace too yeelde our ſelues vnto that which he hath commaunded vs: to witte, too loue our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, to doe good vnto them which ſeeke to doe vs all the hurt they can, to pray for thoſe which ſlaunder and wiſhe vs aſmuch euill as is poſſible. Loe heere wee muſt meditate vpon the Commaundements of God, although wee be as it were conſumed on the earth.</p>
            <p>Now heere we are to note, that it was not without cauſe, that Dauid ſayth, <hi>that he was almoſte conſumed:</hi> For this ſhall euen ſo come to paſſe in vs, when men ſhall iudge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs, and that wee haue already receiued ſentence of death in our ſelues: as S. Paule ſayth in the ſeconde too the Corinthes. Euen ſo Dauid beeing as one condemned too death, and ſeeing no likelyhoode too be deliuered,<note place="margin">2. Cor.</note> ceaſed not for all that to call vpon God. So likewiſe muſt we doe, knowing that hee will neuer forſake vs: for ſee what the cauſe is, that God oftentimes keepeth backe his helping hand from vs, but euen when we preuent him by meane of our owne lightneſſe and inconſtancy. For ſo ſoone as wee are greued ſomwhat more then we are wonted: we ſtraight wayes conclude and ſay, O, all is naught: we are cleane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doone: it is paſt all hope. When we after this ſorte preuent
<pb facs="tcp:7694:103"/>him, it is like vnto a man that would caſt himſelfe into his graue before he is deade, and ſo ſmoother himſelfe. After this manner, ſay I, doe we, preuenting by this meane that ayde, which God hath deferred to giue vs, vntil the time be come, which he knoweth to be moſte meete. Let vs then well conſider, that when God ſhall deferre the ayde which he meaneth to giue vs, although wee ſeeme as deade men, and our life deſperate, yet that hee can reſtore vs againe in the minute of an houre, although in the ſight of men wee were euen as the pictures of death, yet that hee leaueth vs not without life inwardly. For as wee ſee in Winter the trees to be as it were deade, that wee can perceiue neither ſappe, leafe, nor nothing elſe: yet there is life hid in them. Euen ſo fareth it with vs: For when we ſhall be ſtill &amp; quiet attending for ayde at the handes of God, wee are ſure that when Winter is paſt: to wirte, the time of our afflictions, that God will giue vs life, which was before as it were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Now to conclude the Pſalme he ſayth,</p>
            <q>Quicken me according to thy louing kindeneſſe: ſo ſhall I keepe the teſtimonyes of thy mouth.</q>
            <p>We ſee heere, that Dauid ſpeaketh as one that were dead, when he ſayth, <hi>O quicken me,</hi> he ſheweth then that hee was not beaten ſoftely with the rodde, or with a meane affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but was puniſhed euen too the vttermoſte. For hee was ſo dryed vp, as before we haue ſaide, that there was no ſubſtaunce at all lefte in him. Loe what was the cauſe why Dauid after this manner made his petition.</p>
            <p>Let vs learne then, not too flatter our ſelues, when as the Lorde our God ſhall viſite vs with any little affliction, that wee thinke too haue doone euen ſufficiently, if wee call vppon him: But if wee ſhall haue doone ſo an hundreth thouſande times more, yet that wee muſte not giue ouer praying and calling vppon him. And heerein may bee ſeeene the hypocriticall dealing of men: For they are ſo womanniſhely minded and tender hearted, that they thinke themſelues too haue wrought a million of miracles, when as they haue ſuſtained neuer ſo little aduerſitie, no
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7694:103"/>not woorth the value of an houre.</p>
            <p>Moreouer if they be ouer loden with any aduerſity they may be bolde, as they thinke, cleerely too forget both God and his woorde. But our good God wil not haue vs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in this ſorte: For he ſetteth before vs heere, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Dauid for our inſtruction, but yet hee hath ſet it forth vntoo vs for this ende and purpoſe, that wee ſhoulde not ceaſe to continue too cal vpon him in our aduerſities: yea were our afflictions neuer ſo great, &amp; laſted neuer ſo long, yet that we ſhoulde notwithſtanding continually perſeuere in prayer.</p>
            <p>To be ſhorte, let vs vnderſtande, that Dauid made this prayer at ſuch tyme as hee thought not too haue liued any longer, but that hee was as a dead man, when hee ſayeth, <hi>O quicken mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer we may ſee, that his conſtancy was not lyke a puft of winde, but that he perſeuered therein. For although his troubles conteined, that he was as it were in a very depe pit, whereout he was not able too get: yet ceaſed hee neuer but to truſt that god would deliuer him out of it: and there vpon called on him, and receiued greate courage. Namely, he deſireth <hi>too bee quickened</hi> according to the louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God For wee muſt alſo bee at that point, if we will bee hearde, to knowe that God is bounde vntoo vs of his meere grace and fauour: and that wee alſo muſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto him, if wee wil haue him too accompliſhe his promiſes vnto vs. Men muſt not then abuſe themſelues, too looke vntoo their owne dooinges, ne yet too haue regarde vntoo worldly meanes: But that they ſeeke for the ſame in GOD, and in his meere goodneſſe and free gifte, for the which he wil heare them, and receiue them alſo vntoo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. In the ende Dauid proteſteth, <hi>that he wil kepe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the mouth of God.</hi> Now let vs not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hereby, that hee had not kept them before: For wee haue ſeene the cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. But this is to ſignifie, That ſeing in the midſt of the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which I haue ſuſteined, thou haſt alway giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me the grace to perſeuere in faith, &amp; that I haue continually
<pb facs="tcp:7694:104"/>vpon thee, Satan hath not ſhaken me, to cauſe me too doe wickedly, ſince then, O Lorde, thou haſte giuen mee ſuch conſtancy at the time that thou waſt eſtraunged from me: by a more ſtrong reaſon, when thou ſhalt be mine ayde and ſuccour, &amp; ſhalt reſtore me, I ſhall haue a farre greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, to keepe the teſtimonyes of thy mouth.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE ſee howe chaungeable men are. It is very true that when wee ſhall talke of the ſhadowe, wee may ſay that it remooueth and chaungeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery minute of an houre, ſo that it reſteth not but if wee looke well and thorowlye ſearch out that which is in the minde of man: wee ſhall ſee
<pb facs="tcp:7694:105"/>there a great deale more vanitie and chaunge, then is too be ſeene in the very ſhadowe. And that which is more, Dauid ſayth in an other place, that if man were laide in one ſchole, &amp; vanitie in an other, that vanitie which is nothing, would way downe man greately. And wee ſhall not neede too ſtande longe diſputing of this: For euery man by his owne experience can teſtifie what it is, and what it can do, albeit there were nothing written nor yet any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conteined in the Scripture. What reſteth there then for vs to doe. Forſooth wee muſt ſeeke for our conſtancy elſe where then in our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Nowe God giueth vs a very good meane if we will take it, which is, to builde and ſettle our ſelues vpon his word. And for this cauſe it is,<note place="margin">Iſai 40.8.</note> that the Prophet Eſaiah ſayth. <hi>That the worde of God indureth for euer:</hi> Hee had ſpoken before of the frailtie and fickleneſſe of men, as that nothing could be more: &amp; although it might ſeeme that there was ſome ſtrength in them, it is yet incontinent cleane parched and dryed vpp, that it vaniſheth away into leſſe then nothing: But he concludeth and ſayth, <hi>That the woorde of God abideth for euer.</hi> So then, ſee the meane, howe that men (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be tranſitory, and haue conſtancie at all in them) ſhall notwithſtanding haue a perfect conſtancy, and ſure eſtate: to witte, when as they ſhall ſtay themſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the trueth of God and his worde. According to this, it is heere ſayd, <hi>Thy worde O Lorde abideth for euer in heauen.</hi> Some expounde this, as if it had beene ſayde, That becauſe the heauens haue continued long, they render a good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the trueth of God. But heere Dauid namely ſpeaketh of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s becauſe we ſee by them a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſigne of the Maieſtie of God then we ſee here belowe on earth. And in deede in that we are rude and earthly, we had neede to haue God to guide vs, and too lifte vpp our mindes when that he would haue vs to thinke on him: too the ende we might forget the world, &amp; all the corruptible things heere beneath. See the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reaſon why Dauid in this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7694:105"/>maketh the ſeate and houſe of the word of God in heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe we had nede to looke a great deale more hyer then into our owne ſenſes, when wee would comprehend howe God is true and faithfull. When wee woulde feele the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie and aſſuraunce of his woorde, we muſt enter into a more deepe conſideration, then our ſenſe is able too beare, and not looke ſo into the viſible thing, or into that which we conceiue on earth.</p>
            <p>Hee addeth, <hi>That the trueth of God it from generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to generation.</hi> As if hee ſhoulde haue ſayde, It is true. O Lord, that men are heere very circumſpect and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and we ſee alſo howe thinges haue their alterations, ſo that there is nothing which is not wauering and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: wee are as it were in the whirlewindes and tempeſts: and if at ſome time thinges bee in peace and at quiet, it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not longe: and although the creatures bee peaceable and at quiet, yet are the men neuer at reſt, but are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually chafed and troubled. But thy trueth, O Lorde, is ſure and certaine, which can neuer be ſhaken through the alterations and chaunges which heere we ſee, no otherwiſe but by the lightneſſe and inconſtancy of men, when as they doe nothing elſe but wander heere and there. True it is, O Lorde, that all this impayreth no whit the certaintie of thy trueth and woorde.</p>
            <p>Loe heere in ſumme, the meaning of Dauid in this place. Nowe hee bringeth in a proofe of this ſentence, too witte, That <hi>God hath layd the foundation of the earth, and it abydeth:</hi> that is to ſay, That the order of nature hath her courſe, and ſo continueth without ende. And why ſo? <hi>Forſomuch as God hath appoynted them:</hi> becauſe that hee hath ſo declared it, and that al creatures are ſubiect vnto him. This diſpoſing &amp; ordering muſt needs continue in his eſtate. And although wee ſee all things to turne on this ſide and on that yet God alwayes giueth vs ſome viſible ſigne, too ſhewe vs that hee neuer altereth nor chaungeth his purpoſe. And chiefely, that his trueth is neuer ſubiecte too any chaunge.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:106"/>
            <p>We ſee nowe in ſumme what the ſubſtaunce is that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in theſe three verſes.</p>
            <p>Nowe that wee may apply all this too our vſe, and too make our profite heereof, let vs learne too haue recourſe vnto the woorde of God, ſo often as wee ſhall bee aſtony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and knowe not what ſhall become of vs: too witte, all the dayes of our life: For there paſſeth not one quiet day ouer our heads, wherein wee are not mooued too thinke either of this thing or of that. Sometimes the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are eaſie too ouercome: but after, wee ſhall ſee ſome apparaunce of daunger, that ſhall trouble vs a great deale more, yea and ſome one threate or other we ſhall haue that ſhall euen abaſhe vs. And if that were not ſo, yet ſhoulde wee haue occaſions enough in out heads too make vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, that we ſhould not nede to be otherwiſe troubled: but euery one of vs hath in himſelf ſtore of tempeſts &amp; ſtormes, ſo that if there were nothing elſe but our owne very fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes, they would be ſo many whyrlewindes, too make vs neuer to haue quiet mindes. Nowe ſee then a good reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that is, Let vs knowe, that although wee are enuironed with a great number of daungers, although there bee no certayntie in our life: although there is alwayes an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth deathes before our eyes, yea that we thought the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſhoulde ſwallowe vs vpp euery minute of an houre: yet muſt we be peaceable, and holde our ſelues quiet and ſtil, becauſe that God hath layde the foundation of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his woord: and that he hath promiſed to keepe our life. When then, wee ſhall haue the worde of God, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie vs, that he hath care both of our ſoules and bodyes, let vs knowe and be certainly aſſured that heerein conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all our conſtancy.</p>
            <p>So then, let vs rightly applye this doctrine for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that when it is ſayde, that the worde of GOD is permanent in Heauen, that his truethe ſheweth it ſelfe from age to age, &amp; ſo continueth, that it is namely ſpoken, to the ende that we ſhould be patient in the middeſt of all
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7694:106"/>the troubles, giefes, and anguiſhes, which wee may haue, beeing ſhaken amidſt ſo many daungers: and alſo, ſeeing the endleſſe and inceſſaunt chaunges which are heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and nothing elſe but all vnquietneſſe. Let vs then ſee, what is heere to be conſidered for the firſt point: wee muſt not ſeeke to take our reſt in this worlde, for wee ſhall neuer haue it heere: But let vs alwaies haue our recourſe too the trueth of God.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let vs ſee if we can rightly practiſe this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that nothing hinder vs, but that wee may liue in peace and tranquilitie in the middeſt of the moſt great and dangerous confuſions which may light vpon vs. Let vs alſo ſee, that whether the windes blow in this corner or in that, that there be garboyles of war, that there bee peſtilence &amp; famine, and ſuch like, that it ſeemed wee ſhould periſhe a thouſand manner of wayes: yet all they which ſettle them ſelues vpon the woorde of God, wil neuer be but certaine: For they ſhall feele bothe in life and death, that they are in his hande and protection. And hauing this confidence with themſelues, they will make no reckoning of all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall come vnto them: as wee ſee Saint Paule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs too exalte our ſelues againſt all thinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and too come, ſo that wee be fully reſolued, that God loueth vs. When this ſhall be in vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.39.</note> and we ſhall haue heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a good teſtimonie in our owne conſciences, through Fayth and the woorde of God: Loe howe wee may aſſure our ſelues, and ſolace our ſelues in the middeſt of all our troubles and confuſions which heere wee ſee: and by that meanes be neuer at peace and reſte, and not too be greatly turmoyled for any thinge that may come vnto vs the next day. And why ſo? For hath God, who hath declared him ſelfe vnto vs too be our Father, ſpoken it but for a day onely? where as hee hath teſtifyed vnto vs, that hee will haue our ſaluation in his hand? is heere any time lymit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
            <p>Nowe we ſee too the contrary, that God ſayeth, That
<pb facs="tcp:7694:107"/>hee will neuer forſake vs. Our hope then muſt ſtretch it ſelf cleane beyonde the worlde, and ſo we ſhall not bee toſſed with the windes and tempeſtes which ſhall blow againſt vs, to make vs turne back, when as we ſhal haue a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon the word of God. And as concerning this proofe which Dauid addeth, ſaying, <hi>That God hath layd the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the earth,</hi> the ſame is but a little taſt which he giueth vs of the trueth of God. Nowe it is not enough for vs to haue this taſte onely, to knowe whether God be faythfull and that his trueth is euerlaſting. For to proue it to bee ſo, we ſee that neither heauen nor earth, but are ſubiect too corruption, and that all muſte paſſe, onely the woorde of God is ſaid too laſt for euer. And it muſt needes bee ſo: for elſe what ſhoulde become of our ſaluation? It ſhoulde be corrupt very ſoone.</p>
            <p>Let vs not once thinke then, that Dauid his meaning heere is too make a compariſon, and an equall proportion, of the continuance of this worlde, and the conſtancye which wee ſee in the order of nature, with the trueth of God. But he ſheweth vnto vs that euen in theſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thinges, wee might the better perceiue howe faythfull GOD is: and if hee bee true in theſe thinges on the earth, what ſhall hee him ſelfe then bee? I beſeech you tell mee, from whence hath the earth her foundation? It is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bothe vpon the water and alſo vpon the ayre: Loe her foundation. Wee can not poſſibly build a houſe fifteene foote hight vpon the firme grounde but that wee muſte lay a foundation. See all the whole earth is founded onely wauering, and as it were hanging, yea, and vppon ſo bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe deapthes, as that it might be turned vpſidedowne in the minute of an houre, and the whole ſubſtaunce of it vtterly ouerthrowne. It muſt needes then be, that there is a wonderful power of God ſhewed in the conſeruing of it, in the ſame ſort it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth. And that is it which is here ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs: to witte becauſe that God hath ſayde, That the earth was in the middeſt of the worlde, and that it was ſo
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7694:107"/>layde as it is: heereby we knowe what the certaintie of his trueth is. But wee muſt heere forſooth compare the leſſe thinges with the greater, as we ſay. How from the leſſer to the greater? I wil ſhew you by example, If I ſay we did ſe ſuch excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie in the body of a man, as that it might bethought to be euen the very image of God: wherby we knowe the thing that is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that God hath ordayned man to be the chiefe of all his creatures, and giuen him greate dignitie, nobleneſſe, and power ouer all liuing creatures.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6.</note> Euen ſo alſo, in prayſing that which is in man, we may deſcende from the body to the ſoule: and this is from the hyeſt too the loweſt, and from the leſſe to the more: So likewiſe is it in this place, when Dauid ſetteth before our eyes the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature: This is not (as I haue already ſayde) to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and compare the trueth of God, with ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But to the ende wee might reaſon and ſay, If in theſe frayle and tranſitory thinges which are ſubiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee ſee ſuch a conſtancy becauſe it is God his will it ſhoulde be ſo: What ſhall we then ſay of his trueth, which ſurpaſſeth all the worlde? When then we ſhall make ſuch a compariſon, betweene the ſtate of the worlde, and the trueth of God, we may certainly conclude, that God ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienly graunteth vs wherewith too ſettle our ſelues vpon his woorde, we muſte not bee ſo inconſtant as too let our Fayth bee ſhaken, ſo often as wee ſhall ſee the worlde toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with any troubles, but rather too take this place which is heere ſhewed vnto vs by Dauid for our refuge. And this is the ſumme of this place. Nowe it followeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,</p>
            <q>Except the Lorde had beene my delight: I ſhoulde nowe haue periſhed in my trouble.</q>
            <p>Dauid heere ſpeaketh this of his owne proper expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge before hee ſpake of the trueth and excellencye of GOD in generall, and ſayth that it was in
<pb facs="tcp:7694:108"/>heauen: and afterwarde he prooueth it by viſible thinges, which is very manifeſt vnto vs, and which God poynteth out vnto vs, as it were with his finger. In the third place hee ſayth that he ſpeaketh not of vnknowen thinges, that hee might diſpute of them at randon, but that hee had rightly practized that which he had ſpoken, becauſe that hee was preſerued by the woord of God. And therefore hee nowe ſheweth vs, where we ought to ſeeke for this worde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee had generally ſpoken heeretofore. For wee may vſe this name of the woorde of God, and yet it may be hidden in the ayre, or emongſt the Cloudes: But becauſe hee hath giuen vnto vs his word familyarly, and communicateth the ſame with vs dayly, euen in the holy ſcripture: Let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in giuing honor vnto the worde of God. Wee ſay that it is infallible, Let vs not imagine it to be an vnknowen word, but let vs goe vnto that, which God at all times hath giuen to his ſeruaunts: and that is it which is contayned in the law. See then, how God hath firſt declared his woorde vnto vs, wherein our ſaluation is altogither certaine.</p>
            <p>Nowe heere wee haue to note in this ſtreine, that Dauid hauing had ſuch experience, deſerueth wel to be heard, and that they are no vayne woordes which hee heere ſetteth downe before hand: But that God alſo woulde haue it ſo, too the ende wee ſhould giue the more credite vnto it, and that wee ſhoulde no whitte doubt of any thinge that hee teacheth vs, when as hee him ſelfe hath made proofe of all that which he before had ſpoken. And thus much for the firſte poynte. The experience then whereof Dauid ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſhoulde very well ſerue vs in ſteade of our Seale, by which GOD meaneth too make the Doctrine of his Prophet to be of ſo much the more antiquitie. And thus much for this.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let vs learne rightly too vnderſtande, howe ſure wee ought too bee of the woorde of GOD, not too ſeeke for the certaintie thereof without our ſelues, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our owne Conſciences. It is true, that wee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7694:108"/>ought throughly too looke bothe aboue and beneath, too make the teſtimonies which GOD giueth vs too ſerue our faith, too the ende wee might bee certified of the trueth of his word, as already wee haue heard: but yet the principall point is this, for euery man to enter into himſelf, and make ſuch accompt of this certaintie of the woorde of God that it may take ſuch roote in our ſoules, as that wee may there feele it to be ſuch as here it is ſaid: to wit, that it neuer be ſhaken, although the whole world ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and that it is the ſame which muſt giue vs peace and reſt, notwithſtanding it ſeemed, that all were vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne. We muſt then acknowledge the effect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this certaintie, which the Prophet here attributeth vnto the word of God. In ſumme, it is aſmuch as if he had ſaide, that no man is able rightly to feele howe God is faithfull, and his worde certaine and ſure, without he hath a true faith and beliefe thereof within his heart, &amp; the ſame to bee diſcharged of whatſoeuer is contrary to his ſaluation. As namely he ſaieth, <hi>that he ſhould haue periſhed in his trouble, if he had not delighted in the word of God.</hi> Dauid here ſheweth what experience he had: to wit, that he was ſo afflicted, that he was as it were euen in the gulfe of death.</p>
            <p>Now if the worde of God bringeth vs out of the graue, quickeneth vs in death, &amp; preſerueth our health, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that it ſeemeth to be ſwallowed vp in the gulfe, do we not ſee a good proufe giuen vs from God, how firme &amp; ſound it is? So then, let vs well conſider (as we haue already ſaid) that ſince we haue knowen the power of the worde of God, to be ſuch as it is here ſhewed vs, wee may in ſuch ſort reſiſt all the greateſt temptations which the deuill is able craftely to worke againſt vs, ſo that we ſhalbe able to eſcape as it were both from death and the graue. And thus much for this.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond point, Dauid ſheweth vs howe it is that we are preſerued in all our afflictions by the worde of God, how our life ſhalbe ſaulfe, &amp; our health aſſured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And that is, if we delight therein: to wit, that wee bee ſo
<pb facs="tcp:7694:109"/>comforted with the loue which GOD there ſheweth vs and wherewith he certifieth vs, that ſince he hath adopted vs for his children, he will therefore alwayes ſhewe him ſelf to be our father. Wherefore we may boldely recommende our ſoules vnto him, and he will receiue them, ſo that wee ſhall not periſhe, hauing all our refuge ſo vnto him. If wee then content our ſelues ſo, the worde of God will giue vs life in the middeſt of an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth thouſand deaths. But if we heare it without hauing any ſuch affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we taſte not of the promiſſes of God, or els that wee alwayes ſomwhat diſtruſt and doubt, to reaſon how it goeth, and afterwarde wander after creatures, or els builde vpon our ſelues, if wee bee ſo changeable, wee ſhall neuer feele any vertue of the worde of GOD, but may bee ouerthrowne an hundreth times: the lead affliction in the world, ſhalbe as a gulfe to ſwallowe vs vp: that we ſhall not neede the mayne ſea: but euen a finger depth of water too ſmouther and drowne vs, if it were not that we had learned of Dauid, to bee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the loue which God beareth vs: and that by his worde.</p>
            <p>So then, let vs vnderſtand what the true delight of the faithfull is, and that which preſerueth them from death, &amp; quickeneth them: that is, when they are contented with the loue of God, to ſet their whole felicitie there, to haue him to be mercifull and fauourable, to haue this priuiledge to haue recourſe vnto him, being aſſured that he will heare them. See, I ſay, how we ſhould be quickened by the worde of God. Nowe when that Dauid hath declared the profit which he receiued by the conſideration of the lawe, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>That he will neuer forget it.</hi> Wherein hee proteſteth that he will not bee vnthankefull to GOD, as wee are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed.</p>
            <p>Now although wee are not without a great number of vices, yet is this one of the greateſt, that we doe not onely ſo oftentimes ſuffer the benefites of God to eſcape out of our mindes, but we are alſo ſo wicked, as that we deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then for to burie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: we thinke we ſhould haue
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7694:109"/>neuer time enough vtterly to forget them. See, I ſaye, the ſtate and condition of our vile and corrupt nature. And therefore, Dauid in this place proteſteth, that <hi>he will neuer forget the commaundementes of God, bicauſe he hath bin quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them.</hi> And moreouer, he ſpeaketh it not only for him ſelf, but ſheweth vnto vs by his example, what our office &amp; dutie is. When God then ſhall haue thus aided vs in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that he ſhall haue raiſed vs vp euen from the graue through the might and power of his worde, and that wee ſhall feele ſuch a benefite, let vs neuer forget it, but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies mindfull thereof. And yet Dauid meaneth to ſhewe vnto vs a farther point: to wit, that bicauſe the woorde of God hath already profited him, that hee will eſteeme of it and haue it in great price for the time to come. Knowing that it is is not for a time onely, that we muſt bee preſerued and comforted by the word of God, but for euer and euer. This might ſeeme for vs to be very obſcure, were it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto vs more at large. See now then what Dauid his meaning is. If a man be as it were caſt downe, not taſting of the promiſes of God, and when it ſhall be laide before him, that although God afflict his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet that he doth it not vtterly to ouerthrow &amp; deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but to the end to calthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repentance, that afterward they might feele his mercifull goodneſſe. If a man then be thus admoniſhed by the word of God, it may be, that this admonition will ſerue him to no purpoſe, bicauſe he him ſelfe ſeeketh not after the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is ſet before him, and ſo is made voyde of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which is here touched, and by that meane the power of the woorde of God turneth into all euill to himward. What is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be done? Let vs marke wel that which Dauid here ſpeaketh, that he wil neuer forget the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God, bicauſe he hath bin quickened by them. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, when as thou haſt once preſerued me by meane of thy word, that thou haſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto it this power &amp; property, that I being as one dead, &amp; out of the world, haue bin therby fully reſtored to helth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haſt thou taught me what I ought to doe all the daies of my life: that is, I muſt
<pb facs="tcp:7694:110"/>meditate vpon thy worde, I muſt exerciſe my ſelfe therein, and I muſt continually ſtudy to thinke vppon the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which thou of thy fatherly loue haſt beſtowed vppon me to the ende I might hold mee contented, and bee ſure that thou wilt neuer forſake me. The vſe, O Lord, then that I feele by thy worde, hath cauſed mee to applie the ſame to my profite all the dayes of my life: to the ende I might bee able to reſiſte whatſoeuer Satan ſhall craftely goe about to worke againſt mee, and too perſeuer in thy feare and loue, whenſoeuer the wicked and vngodly ſhall make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Thou then, O Lorde, haſte ſhewed mee that thy worde ought alwayes to be before mee. For that neuer lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his power and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth: neither is it a thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and worne by much wearing. A man may ſoone make an ende of a loafe in eating it: but when hee hath ſo done, he muſt looke for more bread. And in continuall drinking of wyne, the hoggeshead wil be empty: but when as the woorde of God hath ſerued to quicken vs, it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſound and whole, without diminiſhing any whit at al. So then, let vs learne after the example of Dauid, too make eſtimation of the vertue and power which God hath giuen to his worde, and neuer forget it. Nowe hee addeth by and by after,</p>
            <q>
               <p>I am thine, ſaue me: for I haue ſought thy commandements.</p>
               <p>The vngodly layde wayte for me to deſtroye me, but I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thy teſtimonies.</p>
            </q>
            <p>After that Dauid had made ſuch proteſtation, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth him ſelfe to GOD, euen declaring that hee hath ſought his commaundementes. And ſo hee ſpeaketh not only of the time paſt, but remaineth alwaies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant in this purpoſe. Now we haue here to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of three points: the one is, the requeſt which Dauid maketh to God, <hi>O ſaue me:</hi> The ſecond is, the reaſon why he deſireth God to ſaue him, <hi>Bicauſe</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am thine.</hi> And afterward he ſheweth how he is gods, that is, <hi>for I,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>haue ſought thy commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And thus we ſee in the firſt place, how God offereth him ſelfe vnto vs, and that hee deſireth nothing els but to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7694:110"/>holde vs in his protection, to haue care of our ſaluation, yea ſo that we come vnto him after the example of Dauid.</p>
            <p>And I beſeeche you, what priuiledge is this, that we haue ſuch libertie to come vnto God, and to commit our ſelues into his handes? whether we wake, or ſleepe, whether wee labour either in the towne, or in the fieldes, that God is as it were a watchman ouer vs, to keepe vs, Yea, and that he hath not care ouer our ſoules, to keepe them from the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes of Satan, but alſo that his fatherly prouidence and loue extendeth it ſelfe euen to our bodies? When God the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſay, giueth vs the libertie, that we may make ſuch requeſt vnto him, I pray you tell me, is not this an ineſtimable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge? But we neuer a whit thinke of this: as may well be ſeene by our ſlackeneſſe and wearineſſe in prayer to God at this daye. And yet for all that, it is not without cauſe that Dauid ſetteth downe here this requeſt: but to the end that we ſhould knowe, that in praying to God, he will graunt vs the grace to comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our ſelues wholy vnto him, no more alſo ſhould wee haue too top great a care ouer our life: for we being aſſured of his loue, ſhould bee contented with all the reſt whatſoeuer. And thus much for the firſt point.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond we are rightly to conſider, that if we will haue God to be our warrant, and to be vnder his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, we muſt needes be his, and may ſay truly, as Dauid here doth.</p>
            <p>It is very true that God keepeth his creatures, who are not worthy thereof, as hee alſo cauſeth the Sunne to ſhine as well vppon the good is on the bad, and that it is of his owne goodneſſe and mercie that the wicked doe liue: but yet to their vtter deſtruction. And when it is here ſaid, <hi>to be kept by God:</hi> it is ſuch a keeping and preſeruation, as that the iſſue thereof is both good and healthfull. And this is not done ſaue onely to ſuch as are truely the poſſeſsion and inheritance of God, and his true houſholde ſeruantes and children Will we haue God then to receiue vs into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and to be our protector? Wil we haue him to take care and charge both of our ſoules and bodies? Let vs firſt
<pb facs="tcp:7694:111"/>be his. And howe ſhall we be his? Forſooth, we muſt come to the third point: to wit, to ſeeke his teſtimonies. Loe then how God will take vs for his poſſeſsion: for hee euen then alloweth vs for his children, when as wee put our whole truſt in him, ſeing that he hath ſo familiarly called and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vs, and hath certified vs by his word, that he will neuer forſake vs. If then we ſo ſeeke the teſtimonies of God, and ſticke vnto them with a ſure faith, let vs neuer doubt but that he wil allowe vs for his houſhold meiny and children, And then we may well ſay with Dauid, ſaue me O Lord. See I ſay, in what maner we ought to come vnto God, if we will be ſure to haue him to protect vs. Now Dauid addeth,</p>
            <q>The vngodly haue laid wayte for me, to deſtroy me: but I wil conſider thy teſtimonies.</q>
            <p>Whereby he doth vs to wit, that although God is ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly purpoſed to be the protector of the faithfull, yet that they are not without a great number of griefes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſubiect to many ſorrowes: and bee maruelouſly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crapped and thereby thinke, that they can not choſe but to fall into the ſnares of the vngodly. And beſides, the ſubtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Satan are great: and againe, all the vngodly which ſerue Satan, and are lead by his ſpirite, ceaſe not to inuent ſubtelties and deceiptes, to entrappe the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, by lying in wayte for them. Dauid his meaning then here, is to declare vnto vs, that although God preſerueth vs, it is not therefore to be ſaid, that we are without moleſtations, and temptations. But what? So it is that the woorde of God ought to ſuffiſe vs, as he faieth, <hi>I will conſider thy teſtimonies.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide. O Lorde, I haue made this my buckler and fortreſſe, which is, that thou haſt promiſed to be my ſauiour: and hereupon haue not forced for all the treaſons, that all the vngodly can conſpire againſt mee. It is very true that they haue layde a platforme to betray me, yea, and it ſeemeth that I am already within their clawes and teeth, ready to be deuoured but thy teſtimonies, O Lorde, haue ſo ſtrengthened me, as that I haue not fainted. Let vs learne then to fight in this ſort againſt all the ſubtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7694:111"/>of Satan, and malices of men, and notwithſtanding that they ſhall goe about to deſtroye vs, yet let vs faſten our eyes vpon the worde of God, attende vpon it, and therein perſeuer vnto the end. Nowe for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion Dauid addeth,</p>
            <q>I haue ſeene an ende of all perfection: but thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is exceeding broade, or large.</q>
            <p>The word then which Dauid vſeth, ſignifieth ſometimes perfection, and ſometimes accompliſhment bicauſe that the things which are come to a perfection, haue an ende. Now he ſaith in ſumme, that when he hath throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of all things, that there is nothing in this worlde which hath not an end, and that is not conſumed by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: but that the word of God is plentiful: that is, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelfe vnto all the creatures of God, and ouer all whatſoeuer wee are able to ſee. See here a ſentence very like vnto that which we haue ſeene in the firſt verſe. Dauid then by this concluſion confirmeth the ſaying which before hee held to wit, that <hi>the word of God is euerlaſting.</hi> Although that we here ſee maruelous alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that we ſe the world toſſed with ſo tempeſtuous whirlewindes, as that there is nother end nor meaſure of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet ſhal we haue in the midſt of al thoſe troubles an euerlaſting aboade in the worde of God, which will aſſure vs of all together.</p>
            <p>Let vs not then meaſure our ſaluation by the preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the world, and as it ſeemeth now in our eyes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may well perceiue and diſcerne the ſame. And why ſo? Bicauſe that all things here belowe haue an ende, as wee haue ſaid, that heauen and earth ſhall periſh: but God hath giuen to vs his truth, which is of ſuch an euerlaſtingneſſe, as that it ſurpaſſeth both heauen and earth. It behoueth vs then to bee lifted vp and rapt with, this eternitie of the kingdome of God, ſo often as his word ſhall be ſpoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, wherein conſiſteth all our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>And according to this holy doctrine let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, with acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our innumerable offences, by which wee ceaſe not daily to prouoke his heauy wrath &amp; indignation againſt vs:
<pb facs="tcp:7694:112"/>Beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him to cauſe vs to feele our wretchedneſſe more, then heretofore wee haue done, to the ende we might be diſpleaſed with our ſinnes, &amp; ſeeke for remedie, where it is ſhewed vs: to wit, that ſeing there is nothing els in vs and in all creatures, but vanitie, that we beſeeche the ſame good God to confirme vs in his promiſſes: that all our ſtudie be wholy there: knowing that all our life reſteth in them, to the ende wee ſearche no other where but there where hee hath promiſed wee ſhall finde it, that is, in his worde. That it would pleaſe him ſo to make vs taſte and ſauoure the power and ſtrength thereof, as that we may be wholy giuen to ſerue him, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing vs into his holy protection and conduct, he wil not impute vnto vs ſo many vices and imperfections as are in vs: but that he will ſupporte them through his goodneſſe, vntil ſuch time as he hath deſpoyled vs of altogether. And that it would pleaſe him alſo, too vſe the like grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure towardes all people and nations of the earth &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſhall ſee in this behalf a great many which will not ſticke to bragge, and ſay, that they haue greatly profited in the woorde of God; but yet if we looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their liues, wee ſhall ſee and finde that they haue profited as much, as if they had neuer read, nor heard, one worde of the holy ſcripture. Moreouer, all the goodly and gay proteſtations which they ſhal make, tende to none other end but to get them ſelues eſtimation and credit: there is noone other thing in them, but a fooliſh and vaine glorious ſhewe, that is, they deſire to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and prayſed, as though they were the moſt able and worthy people of all others. Nowe when we will ſaye that we haue profited in the ſchoole of God, firſt of all we ought to ſhewe by our life and conuerſation whether it bee ſo or no. For this is the true teſtimonie whereunto wee muſt holde vs. God teacheth vs not to the ende we ſhould do nothing els but prattle and babble: but he inſtructeth vs in what maner we ought to liue. Hee then which ſhall leade a diſſolute and wanton life, declareth manifeſtly, that he neuer knew either God or his truthe, Moreouer, the meaning is not that we ſhould ſet foorth our ſelues, to bee had in eſtimation of men, or to get vs reputation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit:
<pb facs="tcp:7694:113"/>but we ought rather to glorifie God, knowing that we are ſo much the more beholden and bounde vnto him, in that it hath pleaſed him too beſtowe ſuch his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vpon vs, as that we ſurmount others in learning, for that commeth not vnto vs by reaſon that wee are ſharper witted, or that we haue gotten it through our owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie: to know, I ſay, the way of ſaluation, but it is a free gift which commeth vnto vs from aboue. Furthermore, when wee ſhall acknowledge this too come from God, it is then great reaſon that we ſhould drawe our neighbours with vs, and like as we are in a good way, euen ſo ought wee to bee deſirous to haue euery one to followe vs.</p>
            <p>Loe to what intent Dauid declareth in this place, that he hath loued the worde of God aboue all, and that by it he hath beene ſo well taught, as that hee ſurpaſſed his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and enemies, and all thoſe which were in great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and credit. Very certaine it is, that Dauid is not here led by an ambitious or high minded ſpirite, meaning to be coyed and clawed, and looking to bee thought to haue greater vnderſtanding then others: but deſireth none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, ſaue that the profite which he had receiued by the lawe of God, might be throughly engraffed in all men, and that it might be a thing common vnto euery one. In very deede, ſince that we are all members of one body: wee ought continually to labour and trauell for the vpholding and mainteining of it one with another: neither ought any of vs to ſerue him ſelfe, and his owne particular profit, but we ought rather to deſire to haue the graces of God to abound in all our neighbours, that euery of them might haue a feeling of them, and that when as wee ſhall haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed this common ſaluation, that we might all with one accorde, and as it were with one mouth, glorifie him. And beſides, Dauid ſheweth ſoone after, that hee was no bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſcholler, to ſhewe it onely in mouth, too haue many times turned ouer the leaues of the lawe of God, and to haue very well vnderſtood it: but ſheweth his life to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greing to his ſpeeche: and that God hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him grace to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7694:113"/>walke according to his will. A great deale the rather ought we then throughly to conſider of the order that is here ſet downe in the firſt verſe: he ſaith, <hi>O Lord, what loue haue I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy lawe: all the day long is my ſtudy in it.</hi> The ſaying which Dauid here vſeth, ſignifieth <hi>ſpeach and meditation.</hi> And the verbe whereof it commeth, ſignifieth, <hi>to ſpeake, to deuiſe, to talke, or rather to applie his minde to any thing, to be therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and ſtadied.</hi> Now there is no doubt, but that Dauid ſpake here of a matter which is conioyned with meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For (as before we haue ſaid) it is not meant by them which make ſome certaine ſhew at their tongues ende, and yet to haue nothing to be found in their life and conuerſation of the thing whereof they babble. Hee then was exerciſed in the word of God, and that not onely for his owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vſe, but to thende alſo to inſtruct his neighbours, and to communicate to them the matter which he had heard and learned. Now we ſee the ſumme and effect of this firſt verſe. He proteſteth that he hath loued the word of God, &amp; that not after a common manner, but with a vehement zeale, in ſuch ſort as that it hath beene his whole purpoſe and drift; as when we haue liking of any one thing, we cannot holde from talking thereof, &amp; continually to be thinking of it. As we ſhall ſee a miſerable couetous man, neuer but hunting after his wealth: occupied about his lands, poſſeſsions, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, &amp; cattle: &amp; muſt make prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for this and that, In like ſort alſo is it with the whoremonger, and the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: and accordingly as euery mans deſire leadeth him, ſo muſt the tongue ſpeake, &amp; euery one apply him ſelf wholy to that. Se wherefore Dauid addeth, that <hi>he was continually exerciſed in the word of God:</hi> meaning thereby to ſhew, howe greatly he hath loued it, as he hath in deede ſaid. And nowe we ſee what thexample is which is here ſet down before vs: for Dauid ſpeaketh not this for himſelf, but telleth vs what we ought to be, if we will haue God to inſtruct vs, and too haue him to make vs partakers of his truth, wherein conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth our whole felicitie and welfare: for if wee wax colde, &amp; make no acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the word of God, we are not worthy that he ſhould giue vs the leaſt taſte thereof. And for this
<pb facs="tcp:7694:114"/>cauſe, we muſt not marueile much, though ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at this daye haue profited in the ſcripture. Although euery man deſireth to be praiſed and eſteemed amongeſt men to bee very able and ſufficient, yet for all that wee ſee what ignoraunce is in the greater number. And therefore it is good reaſon that God ſhould ſhut the gate vpon vs, ſo that we might not haue ſo much as the leaſt entraunce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his woorde. And why ſo? For where is the loue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that Dauid here maketh mention of? Nowe when we ſhall know ſuch a vice to be within vs, we ought by and by to ſeeke to amende it, and beſeeche God to put this cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from out of our heartes, and that it would pleaſe him to enflame vs in ſuch ſort, as that wee might learne to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his worde before all our fleſhly deſires: that we be no more ſo much giuen to all theſe vayne follies of the world, but that we may looke vnto the principal thing. Let vs now come to that which followeth. He ſayeth,</p>
            <q>Thou through thy commaundementes haſt made mee wiſer then mine enemies, teachers, and auncientes.</q>
            <p>He ſetteth down here three ſortes of people, with whom he compareth him ſelfe, and ſaith, that God hath beſtowed this grace vpon him to ſurpaſſe them all. Now here Dauid ſheweth vnto vs, what profit ſhall redounde vnto vs, when as we ſhal reade the word of God, after his example: to wit, that we ſhall get thereby ſuch wiſedome as ſhall defende vs from our enemies to be better learned then our teachers, and thoſe which otherwiſe ſhould haue byn in ſtead of our inſtructours. To be ſhort, that all the men of the world ſhal not haue that which wee ſhall finde there, and that all the wiſedome which is in al the creatures of God, deſerueth not to bee egall and comparable too it. Loe here in effect, that which he meaneth. Now we ought alwaies to cal to minde that which we haue already touched. When as Dauid here ſetteth downe him ſelfe in the firſt ranke, and ſayeth, that hee hath ſurpaſſed his enemies, teachers, and thoſe which were the moſte wyſe, and of greateſt vnderſtanding, that this is not too attribute anye thing vntoo him ſelfe,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7694:114"/>and to his owne perſone: but to the ende that God might be glorified in him: and that we might knowe what profit ſhall redound vnto vs by the word of God, when as we ſhal giue our ſelues vnto it. We ſee then that Dauid had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to him ſelf, but meaneth rather to giue vs occaſion to glorifie God. And beſides his purpoſe is to ſtirre vs vp to the loue, as we haue already touched, which hee had to the word of God: knowing the ſame to be ſo profitable for vs. For what is the cauſe that wee are ſo very negligent, as in deede wee are, in giuing our ſelues to the ſtudy of the holy ſcripture: that we thinke it to be euen labour and time loſt if we onely ſpend but one houre of the day therein? What is the cauſe of ſuch contempt? Verely bicauſe we know not the profit that might come vnto vs thereby: for if we were thus perſuaded that all our wiſedome is and conſiſteth in the worde of GOD, and that without it we are like vnto miſerable beaſtes: ſo that Satan hath caught and holdeth vs faſt bound in his grinnes and ſnares, and that we cannot erre in all the whole courſe of our life if we know this: and againe, that it is ſufficient that God hath taught vs, and ſo haue thereby ſuch a cleare light, as that will neuer faile vs, that we be fenced againſt all the ambuſhes of Satan, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the villanies and deceiptes of the world: if then we were thus throughly perſuaded that the worde of God were ſufficient againſt all this, it is moſt certaine that wee ſhould be a great deale more in loue without all compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the ſtudie thereof, then now we are.</p>
            <p>And therefore, let vs well recorde this leſſon, which is here ſet downe vnto vs by Dauid: to wit, that in the firſt place, wee ſhall be wyſer then all our enemies, if that wee haue the woorde of God alwayes remayning with vs.</p>
            <p>Nowe when he ſayeth, that <hi>hee was made wyſer and had more vnderſtanding then his enemies,</hi> hee meaneth that hee had ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a knowledge, as that God would not ſuffer him to fall into the ambuſhes &amp; priuie engines which the vngodly had layde for him, ſuddenly to bee entrapped &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7694:115"/>caught by their ſubtill traines and pollicies. Loe already a wonderfull profit which we receiue by the worde of God, that although wee be encompaſſed with the wicked which ſeeke nothing but our deſtruction, when as wee doe thinke that we ſhould periſhe euery minute of an houre, yet that we ſhall bee guarded from all whatſoeuer, that they may any way attempt and priuily laye in wayte againſt vs, ſo that we be inſtructed in the worde of God.</p>
            <p>Lo, ſay I, an ineſtimable treaſure: but we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider who they be that are our enemies. For we haue not onely to do with men which ſeeke our hurt, diſhonour, or that which might grieue vs as touching this preſent life: but wee haue Satan, and all his fauourers and mainteiners, which are deadly enemies too our ſoules, who ſeeke nothing els but our deſtruction: yea, not onely as concerning the worlde, but to withdrawe vs cleane awaye from the kingdome of God. Nowe it is very ſure, that when the worde of God ſhall remaine and continue with vs, that wee ſhall haue wiſedome enough too defende and keepe vs from all ſuch enemies. We are then throughly too waye this ſaying: too wit, that if wee applie the worde of God to our owne vſe, after that we haue bene inſtructed therin, we may be ſure to walke in ſauftie and without daunger. And how ſo? Bicauſe God will preſerue vs againſt all our enemies: for although Satan pitcheth his nettes to take vs, notwithſtanding all the marueilous pollicies of men, yea notwithſtanding all our owne craftes and deceites whereunto we are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough inclined of our ſelues, yet cannot we be aſſayled nor ſhaken, either on the one ſide or on the other: but ſhall be well fenced, when as God ſhall hold vs with his hande, and that we ſuffer our ſelues to bee gouerned by him. And beſides our ſoules ſhall not onely bee preſerued, but alſo whatſoeuer we haue to do in this world: neither ſhall our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies be euer able to hurt vs, when as we ſhall haue beene throughly inſtructed. It is very true, it ſhall not bee other wiſe, but that they will moleſt vs: as we ſee the faithful to be greatly troubled and vexed through the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7694:115"/>but what commeth of it? We ſe that God in thende turneth all to their profit, and too the confuſion of thoſe which perſecute them. Moreouer, let vs marke, when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſaith, that he was made wiſer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his enemies, he very wel ſheweth that there were a great many of people, which ſought nothing els but to deſtroy him: neuertheles he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth not ſo much for him ſelfe, as he ſeeketh to ſhewe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon example appertaining to all the faithfull. And this ought the more to encreaſe our courage, to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to profite in the word of God. And why ſo? we had need to be very wel aduiſed, and of good vnderſtanding, bicauſe we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to fight againſt Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paignions, which will neuer ceaſe to lie in priuie waite for vs. And ſince we ſee that the wicked are as hungreſtaruen dogges, &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening wolues againſt vs, their crueltie is inſatiable.</p>
            <p>Seing then we ſee by experience, that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God muſt needes be compaſſed with enemies, &amp; that there are many ambuſhes layde, and many wicked trecheries practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed againſt them: ſo much the more ought we to haue our refuge to this worde, which can only keepe and defend vs, in ſuch ſort as that our enemies can do nothing againſt vs, but that we may be aſſured, as Dauid here maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion. But we muſt note that which he ſaith, that he hath had the word of God continually with him: for ſo he vſeth to ſaye, And that is to ſignifie vnto vs that wee ought neuer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from that which God hath once declared vnto vs, and not to be ſo fitching, as the more part of vs is accuſtomed to be. And there is not that he amongſt vs, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſuch a vice: that although the worde of God hath taken roote in vs, yet can we not hold our ſelues from howling as the wolues do (as we commonly ſaye) when as we ſhalbe vexed with any temptation. But ſee howe Dauid ſheweth vs, that he abode ſtedfaſt &amp; conſtant, whatſoeuer came of it, although hee had a number of enemies which ſought nothing els but to oppreſſe &amp; aſſault him with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible temptations, he notwithſtanding helde the worde of God for euen: and whatſoeuer vexing and turmoiling hee ſawe on thother ſide, he ſtil held him to it. It followeth,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:116"/>
            <p>
               <hi>That hee was wyſer then his teachers: yea bicauſe,</hi> ſaieth hee, <hi>that vpon that was my whole talke,</hi> or, meditation, <hi>as the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of God.</hi> In this, and in the verſe following, Dauid meaneth, that there is no worldly wiſedome, nor doctrine, which is worthy to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with that which wee learne in the ſchoole of God. It is very true that we may wel ſtudy the doctrines of men, and attaine therby vnto ſome iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ye knowe that learning doth fine a naturall mans wit: but what ſhall it be, if wee were the moſt perfect that is poſsible to be ſpoken of in all ſuch knowledge: to wit, in whatſoeuer man can teach vs? It is al but an A.B.C. For we come neuer a whit the ſooner to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by it, but it abideth ſtill in this preſent life. So that, as our life is tranſitorie, and leſſe then nothing: euen ſo alſo muſt we confeſſe, that al the ſciences which men teach vs, are no better then ſmoke: it is a tranſitorie thing which is ſoone vaniſhed. And as there is nothing euerlaſting but the kingdome of God, ſo alſo is there but one onely truth which is a wiſedome euerlaſting, and hath a ſure and euer continuing foundation. See then what Dauid his meaning is here to ſhewe vs, that men may very well teach vs, yea, but that ſhalbe but as an A. B. C. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as wee are come to the ſchoole of God.</p>
            <p>It can not be denied, but that God teacheth vs very wel by the meane of men, as in deede it commeth from him which wee learne, when as men make playne vnto vs his truth, and leade vs in the right waye of the Scripture: but here, Dauid ſpeaketh of that, which might hee taught him, without this doctrine which hee hath learned of GOD, when as hee hath beene inlightened by the holy Ghoſt, and hath knowne what the ſecretes of the lawe are. When then hee hath had this ſpirituall knowledge, hee ſayeth that all whatſoeuer hee had learned of men, was nothing in compariſon. Nowe hee addeth for confirmation,</p>
            <q>That he was wiſer then his enemies.</q>
            <p>Here, hee doth not onely declare, that the word of God inſtructeth vs more perfectly, then all the Sciences in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7694:116"/>worlde are able to doe, but alſo ſcorneth the vſage, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and ſubtletie of all whatſoeuer that may any way come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, ſaying that it is all nothing in reſpect of this wiſdome which we learne in the ſchoole of God.</p>
            <p>Loe heere a place right worthy to be noted and imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our memoryes. For we ſee how men extoll and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them ſelues, when they haue attayned too any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to get them ſelues credite and eſtimation. For if a man be eloquent, and can ſpeake gallantly, and write ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, or that hee hath ſome other eſpeciall ſcience or knowledge, he thinketh him ſelfe a meruelous man, &amp; able to catch the Moone with his teeth, as we ſay. Seeing then it is ſo, that men are ſo raſh and hedſtrong, that they perſuade themſelues to be woonderfull men, if they haue once got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten neuer ſo little knowledge in humanitie, whiche paſſeth no farther then the outwarde elementes of the worlde: by this wee are ſo much the more too be admoniſhed, too eſteeme this heauenly knowledge which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned in the holy Scripture, which we can neuer be able to attaine vnto without it pleaſe God to inſtruct vs: to the ende that in the firſte place, none of vs all ſhoulde bee proude of our good wittes, ne yet of our other excellent aydes, nor too be hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in that wee haue greatly profited at Schole, haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all the liberal ſciences, and to be men of greate expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. When then a man ſhall be the moſte perfect in ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and knowledge, that it is poſibly to be imagined, yet ought we to learne to humble our ſelues, and to caſt all our pride cleane vnder fote that the worldly knowledge which God hath giuen vnto vs to ſerue him, bee ſubiect vnto his worde. Shall we finde a man that ſhall be moſte eloquent, moſt cunning and moſt excelling in euery condition all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? That man I ſay, ought to doe homage vnto God for that which he hath receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him knowing that no worldly ſcience or knowledge ought to ſhadowe or darken him who farre ſurpaſſeth the ſame, becauſe the Heauens are farre aboue the earth. In very deede both two proceed from the meere goodneſſe of God. But to this point muſt
<pb facs="tcp:7694:117"/>it be brought, That whatſoeuer he be that ſhall attayne to the true and heauenly light, muſt ſay, I am nothing O Lord: For all that which thou haſt giuen me commeth alſo from thee, receiue thou then the ſame as the moſt ſpeciall thinge aboue the reſt. And ſince thou haſte ſhewed mee that grace and fauour to be inſtructed by thy worde, worke ſo in mee I beſeech thee, that all the reſt yeelde ſuch honor and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage as appertained to this wonderful knowledge which I haue learned in thy ſchoole.</p>
            <p>See then, what it is that Dauid meaneth to learne vs by his example. And beſides, when he ſayth, <hi>That he is become wiſer then his auncients:</hi> It is to ſhewe vs, that wee ought too haue ſuch a certaintie of our fayth, as that when there ſhall bee layde before vs what ſoeuer ſhall bee alleadged of this worlde, that it be ſayde, And what I beſeech you? muſte not the auncient men bee wiſe? They lyued thus in the olde time: There are a great number of perſons: And wee ſee a great many to be of the contrary opinion to this. If then they ſhall alleadge vnto vs men for their age, for their long experience and all their ſtudy, and whatſoeuer elſe that may bee ſayde: What of all this? All that can bee ſayd, is nothing in reſpect of this word of God. So then, wee ſee howe Dauid after he hath taught vs the way vnto humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the end we ſhould preſent before God all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is in vs, he ſheweth againe that the word of God ought to be of that authoritie with vs, as that wee ſhoulde not feare too walke the way which hee hath taught vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſee all the reſt of the world to go cleane cotrary. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſhal heare that that may be ſaid, And what I pray you? Is it poſſible that they which are helde and accounted to be ſo wiſe, ſhould erre like poore and miſerable beaſtes? yea, and that the ſame hath continued ſo many yeeres? wil any man ſay, that it hath no reaſon for it in all the whole worlde? Is it poſſible that this may be ſo? we ought not to trouble our ſelues for all theſe ſpeeches. And why ſo? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: hath god ſpoken the word? Then, I ſay, let mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; wit ſtay there, let it humble &amp; make it ſelfe nothing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7694:117"/>worth, and let vs confeſſe with Dauid, that there is one onely word of God, which ought to beare rule ouer all, &amp; that this woorde hath ſuch an excellent wiſedom in it ſelfe, as that it ſhall conſume all the knoweledge and wiſedome whatſoeuer, that men thinke they haue. Nowe like as the faythfull ought to ſcorne that which men on their behalfe ſhall alledge, to the ende too diuert them from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, and the certaintie which they haue in his woord: ſo alſo let vs learne, that the olde men ought not too bee opinatiue againſt God, vnder this ſhadowe that they haue ſeene much: that they haue ſeene many thinges euen before their eyes: as many of them there are which in this poynte vnder the ſhadowe of their age, would goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde God, and remaine in their opinion ſtiffe and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſaying, What I beſeech you? I haue lyued thus longe and thus many yeeres, and would you haue mee nowe too chaunge my condition, and manner of dealing: It is for wilde headed young Gallants ſo to doe, which knowe not what it meaneth. But ſince I haue liued thus long: bee it as be may, I will ende my life ſo. See then howe aged men will go beyond God. But in this place Dauid ſheweth vnto vs, that when as we ſhall be young as hee hath before trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that although we haue hot boyling affections, &amp; that our wittes are troubled with many hard matters, that wee be without all conſideration: yet if we be ruled by the word God, no dout it wil make vs peaceable &amp; quiet, &amp; cauſe our life to be rightly gouerned. And thus much forthe younger ſort. As touching the ageder, it is foliſh arrogancy in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to build vpon that which they haue ſeene, and paſſed through their hands: but let them know that true wiſdome which is, to be ordered by God, is common to all: &amp; that therefore they ought to apply and giue them ſelues therto in all ages. And for this cauſe it is that S. Iohn in his Canouical Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.12.13.14.</note> after that hee hath made a generall exhortation vntoo all men, ſayeth <hi>I ſpeake vnto you fathers, to the ende you ſhoulde haue regard vnto him who is the Father of all the world, I ſpeake vnto you yong men, to the end you ſhould cal vppon your heauenly
<pb facs="tcp:7694:118"/>father. And you olde men, I ſende you againe vnto him which is from the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To beſhorte, Dauid ſheweth vnto vs by this place, that the faithfull haue wherein too reioyce, when as they are taught in the worde of God: that they haue whereon too ſtay and aſſure them ſelues, knowing that they ſhall neuer want any thing: that they ought not to be drawen neither this way nor that way, becauſe they follow him of whome they helde the doctrine. So then, they beeing ſettled heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, may be able too make their parte good without any great a doe: and when they ſhall ſee euery man goe aboute to withdrawe them, let them pray vnto God that hee will giue them the grace to holde them ſelues ſimply vnto him. Loe heere Dauid his meaning. Nowe hee addeth ſoone after.</p>
            <q>I haue refrayned my feete from euery euil way: that I might keepe thy woorde.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid teacheth vs, that they which are deſirous to ſerue God and to ſtick to his worde, are neuer without afflictions. But what is then to be doone? We muſt be of a good courage to withſtand all the temptations which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can any way aſſayle vs with, to withdraw &amp; turne vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is good. <hi>I haue</hi> ſayth he <hi>refrayned my feete from euery euill way.</hi> And had Dauid neede of this? hee that was an holy Prophet, yea, and ſuch a one as wee ſee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture too haue reigned in, euen from his youth: Hee then hauing receiued ſo excellent graces of God, beeing a mirror of all perfection, was it needefull that hee ſhoulde keepe him ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery euill way? It ſhould ſeeme that he was alredy vtterly paſt going any euil way: Yea, but becauſe he was a mortall man, he was not for all that without bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incompaſſed with many vices and euill luſtes againſte which he was to fight. And in deede, we ſee how God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred Dauid to fall once ſo greeuouſly, as that his fall ought to be an horrour vnto vs all.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let vs well conſider, that if it was needefull for Dauid too fight againſt the temptations which might
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7694:118"/>withdrawe him from the right way, and that hee was with much to doe, turned away from euill wayes to ſerue God: euery of vs verily ought a great deale more too enforce our ſelues: For we are nothing ſo forwards as he was. For if hee hath gone on an hundreth paces, wee haue hardly gone on that way three or foure. So much the more then ought we rightly to practiſe this doctrine, when it is ſaide, that we ought to refraine our feete from euery euill way. And too doe this, let vs a little beholde howe naturally wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned to wickedneſſe. We neede neuer once too remoue our armes, legges, head, nor any thing elſe within vs to doe wickedly: For we are altogither giuen therto. And beſides, we are as it were vpon the yſe. I pray you tell mee, when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not able to hold himſelf vp, that he ſhal haue neither feete, nor legges, but that all ſhall tremble and be afrayde, and ſhall be ſet vpon the yſe, and in a ſteepe place, howe is it poſſible for that man to hold him ſelf vp? In like ſorte is it with vs: for firſt &amp; formoſt there is nothing in vs but debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and weakenes: &amp; beſides, what is our life in this world? Haue we any firme or certaine place to holde or ſtay vs in? We are alwayes vpon the yſe, conſidering the temptations which aſſayle vs on euery ſide. And Dauid alſo vſeth this ſimilitude in another place: and yet this is not all, that wee are vpon the Yſe: but the place is alſo ſteepe too bring vs downewarde. The more therefore haue we neede too pray vnto God, that he will ſtrengthen vs, to the ende wee bee not ouercome of the euill: For otherwiſe, wee ſhall neuer come to that ende and perfection, conſtantly too abide by his worde.</p>
            <p>Nowe when Dauid ſayth that <hi>He kepte him ſelfe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery euill way,</hi> Hee meaneth not that hee was ſo throughly preſerued from all, but that he might be amended. For as we haue already ſaide, hee fell ſo horribly, as that the very thought thereof ſhould make the hayres of our heade too ſtand vpright. He meaneth not that his life was ſo perfect, as that he was able to ſay, that hee fayled not: in ſome one pointe, and that he had wholely fulfilled the law of God.
<pb facs="tcp:7694:119"/>That is not the intent of Dauid. What is then his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? he meaneth ſimply; that for the holding of himſelfe in the obedience of God, and keeping of his woord, it was needeful for him too reſiſte a number of temptations: too ſtand vpon his guarde, and to be watchfull, or elſe that hee ſhould be throwne downe hedlong an hundred thouſande times. And hereby he admoniſheth vs, that if we wil follow the way of ſaluation, and take good heede that wee be not turned therefro, that there is no queſtion of bending, nor of leading vs heere and there, but that wee muſt remaine conſtant in the vocation of God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are once brought into it by him. It followeth anon after:</p>
            <q>I haue not declined from thy iudgementes: for thou haſte taught mee.</q>
            <p>Lo in ſumme what Dauid heere ſayth, that becauſe God hath inſtructed him, he hath not turned away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. When he ſaith, <hi>That hee hath bene taught by God,</hi> he meaneth not that he hath learned any ſuch ſimple knowledge as is with vs, when God ſheweth vs that fauor and grace, to haue his word faithfully handled amongſt vs, his Goſpel to be preached, or that wee haue Lectures reade vnto vs, which are requiſite to our ſaluation. For we ſhall haue a great many hearers, which ſhall yet profite nothing at all, becauſe it pearceth not their eares. Dauid therefore ſpeaketh heere of ſuch a manner of inſtruction as ſpecially belongeth to Gods choſen. For this grace is not common to all: but God beſtoweth it on them on whome it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him: neither muſt we ſay that we are giuen thereto as of our ſelues: But when as it ſhall pleaſe God to inſtruct vs, the ſame proceedeth from his meere good will and mercie. So then, Dauid ſaith not ſimply in this place that hee was taught, becauſe he had a Booke of the lawe, and that it was made plaine vnto him: but his meaning is that hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by the ſpirit of God. And for this cauſe declyned he not from the right way. Nowe he addeth in the end for a concluſion:</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:7694:119"/>
            <q>O how ſweete are thy woords vnto my throte: yea ſweeter then hony vnto my moath.</q>
            <p>This ſentence hath beene already handled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will no longer ſtand vpon it. There are two things in the woorde of God which we ought rightly too keepe. The one is, the maieſtie which God ſheweth vnto vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to the ende we ſhould be brought to a reuerence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by euery one ſhould humble himſelfe, and ſay, It is meete O Lord, that we tremble and fall downe before thee. As alſo it is ſaid by the Prophet Iſaiah that the ſpirite of God ſhall reſt vpon thoſe which tremble at the woorde of God. The firſte duetie then that wee owe vntoo the woorde of God, is this reuerence and feare. Becauſe, I ſay, that God ſheweth there his maieſtie vnto vs, that we might be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by abaſed and humbled: to be ſhort that we ſhould haue it in great admiration. The ſeconde is, that it is ſweete and amiable vnto vs. For we might in ſome ſorte very well feare the worde of God: and yet for all that wee ſhould not bee touched therewith as was meete.</p>
            <p>And in very deede, you ſhal ſe very many which wil not ſtick to ſay, Loe God, which ſpeaketh, &amp; therfore it is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that wee ſhould lay our eares vnto him: But that they ſhould bee ſubiecte vnto him, in all, and through all, they make thereof no noueltie, but caſte that farre inough off. And that which is more, They woulde if it were poſſible, pluck him but of his Throne, and make voyde and caſte of all inſtruction to the end they would not be ſo ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept in: to be ſhort, that they would neither be ſubiect to God, nor too what ſoeuer elſe might bee ſayde vnto them. Nowe in the ende he ſayth,</p>
            <q>Through thy commaundements I get vnderſtanding: therefore I hate all the wayes of falſhoode.</q>
            <p>Wherein hee ſignifieth vnto vs, that wee ſhall neuer hate that which is euill, vntill ſuch time as wee know, what goodneſſe is. It is very true that we ſhall ſomtimes ſee men to haue a great deſire to doe good, forſooth as they thinke:
<pb facs="tcp:7694:120"/>But indeede that is nothing: all is but hypocriſie, vntil ſuch time as God hath ſo taught vs, that wee might knowe and diſcerne in good earneſt and ſay. Loe it is God that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and therefore let vs ſee what it is that hee ſayeth vnto vs. And ſo after that we are fully reſolued in his truth, then ſhall we beginne to hate all the wayes of wickedneſſe: For it cannot otherwiſe be, but whatſoeuer is againſt God wee muſt needs deteſt and abhorre. For howſoeuer Satan inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth himſelfe to carry vs to doe wickedly, we ought too haue this by and by in our mindes. What, ſhall we eſtrange our ſelues from our creator, whoſe we are? Shall the deuill beguile vs too make vs renounce him, who hath ſo dearely bought vs? And beſides we alſo knowe, that the health of our ſoules, and all our felicitie conſiſt in the obedience of our good God. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal be thus taught by the word of God, we ſhall hate all wicked wayes. Without this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, it muſt needs be that we ſhould be wholy inclined thereto, and that the deceits of Sathan ſhall pleaſe vs: as we ſee it come to paſſe emongſt the infidels, vnto whom we ſhal be very like, without God reſtraine vs with a bit. For if we walke after our owne nature and fantaſie, what ſhall bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all our wicked wayes? And ſo let vs learne, that we ſhall neuer be brought to that which Dauid heere ſpeaketh of, vntil ſuch time as wee are inſtructed and vnderſtande it by the word of God, and the teſtimonyes of his lawe.</p>
            <p>And according too this holy doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of our faultes, beſeeching him to make vs ſo to feele our wretchedneſſe, as that we may learne too ſeeke our felicitie in him onely. And becauſe hee ſo familiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth vs by his woord, let vs not bee ſo accurſed as too reiect this ineſtimable treaſure whereof, wee may be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but that beeing in poſſeſſion thereof, wee might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe dayly more and more in the knowledge which hee hath giuen vs, and continue therein vnto the ende, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as wee ſhall attaine vnto that Heauenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce, and too the full poſſeſſion of that eternall reſte
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7694:120"/>which he hath promiſed vs, after that we ſhall be deliuered from all the aſſaults of this fraile and tranſitory life. That he wil not onely beſtowe this grace vpon vs, but alſo vpon all people and nations of the earth. &amp;c.</p>

But becauſe wee are ſo colde &amp; blockiſhe in reading and hearing of that which God declareth vnto vs, it is meete we ſhould be ſtirred vp therto ſom other wayes, and be ſhewed for what cauſe the word of God ſhall profite vs, when as we ſhalbe thus wiſe and of this mind, throughly to exerciſe our ſelues, &amp; to apply our whole ſtudy therein. And ſee why Dauid purſueth this matter ſo diligently. For beſides that which we haue already ſeene heere before, hee addeth &amp; ſaith, <hi>Thy word is a Lantern vnto my feere, &amp; a light vnto my pathes.</hi> Wherby he ſheweth, that it is an ineſtimable treaſure which we ſhal receiue when as we be taught by the word of God: to wit, that we ſhall neuer erre al the dayes of our life, as the vnbeleeuers do, who know not whether they go, but walke at rando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Dauid ſheweth vnto vs, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſhalbe guided by the word of God, we ſhalbe without al danger of falling. Now becauſe it is a very eaſie thinge for a man to ſay thus, it ſeemeth at the firſt ſight that this ſaying is ſo common, as that we neede not to ſtay any longer vpon it. But in the meane while let vs ſe how the world practizeth that which is heere ſpoken. In deed we ſhall ſee it all cleane contrary, for there are very fewe that wil abide to be guided by the word of god: but the more part reiect it, &amp; like rather to follow their own wills and deſires, or rather can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be gouerned as it pleaſeth men, ſo that they will not ſuffer God to beare any rule or authoritie ouer them. Therefore let vs well mark what this importeth, when as it is ſaid, That the word of God hath bin as it were a Lantern vnto the feete of Dauid, &amp; as a light vnto his pathes. Nowe hereby he ſignifieth, that he meaneth not to bee wiſe in his owne conceite, but hath ſought how he ought to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the word of God, &amp; ſo wholy held him ſelf thereto.</p>
            <p>Now if this hath beene a neceſſary poynt for Dauid, let none of vs thinke that we can go beyond him. And ſee alſo why S. Peter writing too all the faithful in generall, telleth them, that they ſhould doe very well to be attentiue and to take hede to the word of God, as to a light ſhining in darke places.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</note> By this S. Peter declareth vnto vs, that it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7694:121"/>cauſe that Dauid hath vſed this ſimilitude of a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne. And why ſo? For he ſayth, that we being in the world are as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the darke: &amp; to proue it to be ſo, I beſeech you what wiſdom is in any of vs? Although that euery of vs eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of him ſelf inough, &amp; a great deale more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> needeth, yet for all that when as wee ſhall be throughly knowne, we ſhall finde all our vnderſtanding too be full of vanitie and follie, and although we think our ſelues to haue a goodly light, yet are we in a deepe dungeon of darkeneſſe. And beſides, let vs ſeeke all the meanes poſſible too guide and gouerne vs well heere in this worlde, yet ſhall it be alwayes but darkeneſſe.</p>
            <p>Let vs then vnderſtand, that it cannot be choſen but that we muſt be as ſtrayed wilde beaſtes without the woorde of God, and that without it there is neither way nor ſtay for vs. And although wee thinke our ſelues to be wiſe inough, yet ſhall wee be altogether abuſed: and when as wee ſhall thinke vs to be fully reſolued, yet ſhall all our caſe &amp; eſtate be but ſmoke. When then we ſhall knowe this too be true, we may very well ſay with Dauid, that the woorde of God is in ſteade of a Lanterne vnto vs. For what is the cauſe that we will not be ordered &amp; ruled by God, but either by reaſon of our pryde, or elſe becauſe we know not our own want? Some of vs are hindered through a vaine fooliſhe opinion which we haue of our ſelues, that wee are ſufficiently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned too iudge of that which is good and profitable. Loe heere is the very cauſe why wee will not giue place vnto the worde of God.</p>
            <p>There are other ſome of vs: that although wee truſte not ſo much vnto our owne wiſdome, yet knowe wee not what a miſery it is to be heere, as it were in a place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and that there is no ſtay of all the whole courſe of our life. And heerevppon wee contemne the woorde of God, and make no accounte of it. So then, wee muſt come too this humilitie that beeing wholly throwne downe as touching the preſumption of our wittes, we muſt ſuffer our ſelues too be taught of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:122"/>
            <p>And beſids that we might alſo know, that our ſtate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is too too miſerable, vntil ſuch time as we are lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this lantern. Now then, like as Dauid ſheweth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by his example, that we ought not to haue any other guide, nor ſtay, but that which proccedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God: Euen ſo alſo ſheweth hee vnto vs, that if ſo be we bee teachable of God &amp; accept him as our ſcholmaiſter, &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelues to him, that we ſhall finde light inough in his word, that we nede not to feare to be confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded as though we knew not which way to turne vs. For God will giue vs ſufficient light in his word, to lead vs to ſaluation. And this is ſuch a comfort as cannot be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly inough expreſſed: For as it is declared, that we are miſcrable blind ſoules, and that whilſt we walke in this world, we are but in darkenes, ſee how God putteth a remedy into our hands: that is, that we ſhould heare him ſpeake, and that we ſhould learne to be ordered by his word; &amp; that then, although this ſame world be a maze, although we haue many troubles in our life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the deuil neuer ceaſeth craſtely to inuent many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits to turn vs from the right way, yet we ſhalbe aſſured to go ſtraight, &amp; to attain vnto ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And by this wee may ſee how Satan hath poſſeſſed the papiſts, when as they ſay, that the word of God is ſo darke, that wee are neuer able once to bite at it: and that we ought not to ſtay our ſelues thereon, becauſe it is ſo vncertaine a thing: &amp; beſids that it is alſo a noſe of wax, which a man may turne what way he liſteth. They ſhame not to ſpue out ſuch horrible blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But contrariwiſe, let vs truſt vnto the ſpirit of God, ſpeaking by the mouth of Dauid: to wit, that if we be ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by the word of God, we neede not to feare falling: &amp; that there is no rule ſo certain. For although the deuil went about with a thouſand deceits to turne vs this way and that by crooked bypathes: yet muſt we be fully aſſured that the word of God is a lantern vnto our feete, to lead vs the right way. Neuertheles Dauid ſheweth vnto vs, howe we ſhonlde ſeele ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie comming vnto vs by the law of god: to wit, when as we ſhall receiue it with harty affection. For he ſaith,</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:7694:122"/>
            <q>I haue ſworne and will performe it: that I will keepe thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgements.</q>
            <p>Nowe heere hee ſheweth, that if there bee a wauering minded ſpirit, which readeth the Scripture for curioſities ſake, the ſame muſt needes remaine and continue alwayes blinde and ignoraunt: as we ſhall ſee many of them which doe nothing elſe but turne ouer the leaues, and wander in ſuch ſorte, as that there is neither firmeneſſe nor yet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in any of them. And what is the cauſe thereof? For ſooth it is, becauſe they ſeeke not God with a right &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt affection. If we then will haue the commoditie, which Dauid heere ſpeaketh of, we muſt come back againe to the woord of God, and apply all our ſtudy ſo couragiouſly, as that wee deſire nothing elſe but too bee inſtructed in this trueth, and to ſubmit our ſelues wholly vnto it. And yet Dauid was not contented to ſay that this was his onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: But ſayth, that hee had ſworne and was ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly purpoſed to obſerue it: For the word which he vſeth, ſignifieth, that I will eſtabliſh it: to wit, I will wholly giue my ſelf vnto it: for I am ſo reſolute in this matter, as that I will neuer be turned away from it. Wherby he ſheweth, that there is no queſtion, but that we haue certaine ſmall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſlip vs, but wee muſt haue ſuch a feruent zeale, as poſſeſſeth our whole minde: and after we muſt with this zeale be conſtant, becauſe then we ſhalbe able rightly to ſee thoſe men which ſo trimly and fairely puſ and blowe at vs. But what? This is but a falſe fire as we ſay. Nowe if wee bee truely affected to ſerue God, the ſame our affection muſte be firme and ſure, that we may vnfaignedly ſay with Dauid, that we haue ſworne, and are fully purpoſed too ſtand and abide by this matter. In very deede heere may ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſe: For it ſhould ſeme that Dauid hath too too much preſumed of him ſelf, to ſweare that he wil keepe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of God. For we are not able to promiſe any thing, which is not in our power and ſtrength. If a man ſhal thruſt in himſelf to promiſe that which he hath not, he of right is to be accuſed of follie: for euery man wil ſay, that it is great
<pb facs="tcp:7694:123"/>arrogancy in him becauſe he hath paſſed his bounds. Now when as wee ſhall haue throughly conſidered heereof, we ſhall finde that it is impoſſible for any mortall man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to obſerue the Commaundements of God.</p>
            <p>This ſhould ſeeme then at the firſt ſight, that the othe which Dauid heere ſpeaketh of, ought rather too be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended then commaunded: But heere are two things too be conſidered of: The one is, that when the faithfull binde them ſelues ſo vnto God, they lay not this foundation in their owne proper ſtrength, they looke not into their own abilitie, but they deſire of God to accompliſh that whiche they haue promiſed him. And why doe they ſoe? Now let vs note, that heere he ſpeaketh of the commaundementes of God. And we haue here already declared, that when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid nameth the lawe, hee looketh not ſimply too the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, but alſo to the promiſes: and in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes it is ſaide, that God will circumciſe the heartes of his children: He ſayth, that he wil ſo liuely touch them, as that he will bring them into his obedience. So then (as we haue already ſaid) the faithfull binde not them ſelues to God to do any thing of their owne power &amp; ſtrength, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to fulfil what ſoeuer is wanting in them, to ſupply their weakeneſſe, and to ſend ſuch remedy as hee knoweth beſt to be moſt needefull and expedient for them. See then with what confidence Dauid hath ſworne too obſerue the Teſtimonyes of God: hee did it not, I ſay, of any vaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that he had conceiued of his owne power and ſtrength, ne yet that he was able to doe it, no, he attributed nothing to his owne ſtrength: But ſweareth and doth it, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the promiſe of god, by which promiſe he declareth that he wil by his holy ſpirit gouerne al thoſe which are his. Loe whervpon Dauid ſtayed himſelfe. Now by &amp; by follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the ſecond point: to wit, that Dauid hath ſworne too obſerue the teſtimonies, yea euen ſtaying himſelf vpon that which God hath promiſed, that he wil vpholde vs through his mercye, that although wee halte and that all the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which we go about to yeeld vnto him be weake and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7694:123"/>faultie, becauſe it is done but by halues, yet he not hauing reſpect to al our faults, meaneth to make a taſte of the deſire which we ſhall haue to pleaſe him: &amp; in effect, wil accept our ſeruice as it is, diſpenſing with all the faultes which ſhall be mingled amongſt them. Which thing Dauid conſidering, was able to ſay that he would obſerue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God. So then let vs note, that when the faithfull binde themſelues to obſerue the word of God, they muſt not truſt to them ſelues, ne yet be puffed vp with a fooliſh opinion, that they haue the power to do it: but they muſt ſay. Acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh thou this, O Lorde, and then I will followe it: write thy lawe O Lorde, in mine hearte, and then ſhall I haue a deſire to ſerue thee: and beſides, Let the faithful alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God wil not handle them ſharply: yea &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they faile in a great number of pointes, ſo that they are not able to obſerue one only point, nor iot perfectly: yet wil he ſpare them through his free goodnes &amp; mercie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithful &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god ſhal haue knowen thus much, and ſhall ſweare that they will obſerue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God: yet let them not ceaſe for all that too flie vnto the forgiuenes of their ſinnes, that they may feele the ſame too be a neceſſary remedy agreeable to the will of God, for the fulfilling of one parte of his commandements. We ſee now then why Dauid hath ſworne to keepe the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and that he wil neuer chaunge this purpoſe in his hart. Now he maketh two requeſts immediatly after: whereof, the one is to be quickened and reſtored. Wherein he ſheweth that which I haue alredy touched: which is, that hee was not ledde with a fooliſh preſumption of his owne power &amp; ſtregth. For he which deſireth god to be reſtored, confeſſeth that he liueth not as of himſelf, but that he muſt needs liue by the grace &amp; goodnes of God. And yet Dauid maketh this confeſſion more expreſly, when he addeth the reaſon why he vſeth to make ſuch requeſt: <hi>For I am very ſore afflicted O Lord,</hi> ſaith he. See then Dauid who confeſſing him ſelf to be troubled, and as it were vtterly made nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecheth god for to reſtore him. Shal we ſay that he truſted to
<pb facs="tcp:7694:124"/>owne ſtrength? or that hee attributed any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto him ſelfe? we ſe the cleane contrary. So then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which we haue already declared, let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he ſware not vpon any vaine preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but becauſe he knewe that God would neuer fayle him. And this is the reaſon why he toke vpon him this boldenes. And that is it which he addeth: <hi>According to thy word:</hi> that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy promiſes. Now we ought throughly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all what ſoeuer that is heere ſaid. <hi>Quicken me O Lorde,</hi> ſaith he. And thus much for the firſt point. Wherin he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth that he liueth not as of him ſelf, but defiereth it of God. And afterward, he addeth the reaſon, ſaying after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>I am very ſore aflicted.</hi> Whereby hee declareth vnto vs, that we are not able too releeue and maintaine our ſelues, when as our ſtrength fayleth vs, but that it is God which muſt put to his helping hand. And beſides we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he will helpe vs, and be ready to reſtore vs, ſo that we will deſire him, and call vpon him, &amp; haue recourſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his goodneſſe. Loe heere a mightie comforte for all the faithful, when as they finde them ſelues to bee ſo without ſtrength, as that they feele them ſelues too fainte, too be cleane caſt down, and to ſee nothing elſe in them ſelues but death: yet may they be fully aſſured &amp; reſolued, that God will alwayes be their watchman, too reſtore and quicken them. And why ſo? To wit, according to that which Dauid addeth when he ſayth, <hi>According to thy promiſes.</hi> Then it followeth, that God hath promiſed too reſtore and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his, when as they ſhall be in death. And therefore wee ſhall neuer be able too make our requeſt in faith, as Dauid heere hath doone, if that wee haue not the promiſes of God. For, as we haue before ſaid, it is a foolehardines in men to put foorth them ſelues too pray vnto God as they liſte, without beeing ſure and certaine of his will before.</p>
            <p>See then the cauſe which mooued Dauid ſo expreſſely too ſette downe here the promiſe of GOD. Nowe this promiſe was not made too him alone, this is no perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Priuiledge, as wee ſay, appertaining to one man only:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7694:124"/>But it is a generall rule which we muſt holde, that God wil raiſe vp againe from death thoſe which are throwne down, and as it were made nothing: yea euen when as they doe call vpon him, and acknowledge, that it commeth of his owne pure grace that they ought to be ſo reſtored, and not otherwiſe. Nowe here is yet another requeſt which hee maketh,</p>
            <q>O Lord, I beſeeche thee let the freewill offringes of my mouth pleaſe thee: and teach me thy iudgements.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid deſireth God to accept the praiſes which he ſhall render vnto him. For the oblations whereof Dauid ſpeaketh, are nothing els but prayſe and thankeſgiuing, by which Dauid acknowledgeth the benefites of God. And yet for all that, he in very deede looketh vnto the common order of the lawe: For when a man hath beene cured of a diſeaſe, or hath beene deliuered from ſome daunger, or els that God hath indued him with proſperitie, hee commeth to the Church to make his oblation or offring, for an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall teſtimonie, and too acknowledge howe greatly hee is bounden vnto God. Dauid had ſmall regarde to any ſuch ceremonies, but yet he noteth and expreſſeth the ende and the vſe, that is, that we ſhould ſtay vs vpon the principal: for if a man ſhould ſacrifice a beaſt, that were nothing at all. And wherefore then ſerued ſuch maner of ſacrifice? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth it was an aide and help: bicauſe it is nedefull that we ſhould be always ſtirred vp. And beſides, this is a good aduertiſement to ſhewe vs, that when we will giue GOD thankes for his benefites which he beſtoweth vpon vs, wee muſt come vnto him by the mediation of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: for we are not once worthy to open our mouthes to honour God, bicauſe our lippes are vncleane and defiled. And ſo we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowing our vnworthines, muſt come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes vnto God by him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14.15.16.</note> as alſo the author to the Hebrewes exhorteth vs to do. For he namely declareth that vnto vs, that it is onely Ieſus Chriſte, which giueth vs acceſſe vnto God his father, to confeſſe his bountie towardes vs: and otherwiſe, wee ſhall but profane
<pb facs="tcp:7694:125"/>his name, yea he will not accept our praiſes and thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but they ſhal eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were ſtinke in his noſethrilles. Se then to what ende the ſacrifices are. But Dauid notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſheweth, that the principall ende of the benefites of God is, that our lippes ſhould open them ſelues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his goodneſſe, when as wee haue proued and felte it. And that is it which he ſpeaketh of in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Pſalme,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116.11.12.</note> What reward ſhall I giue vnto the Lord: for al the benefites that he hath beſtowed vpon me? I will receiue the cup of ſaluation: and call vpon the name of the Lorde: as if he ſhould haue ſaid, that he knewe none other waye to pleaſe God but to giuethankes vnto him, when as hee had liberally beſtowed all the benefites of the world vpon him, in ſuch ſort as that he felt himfelfe moſt bounden vnto his goodneſſe Euen ſo likewiſe will hee bee contented with vs, when as we render vnto him ſuch thankes. Yea, but in the meane while let vs conſider that Dauid knewe, that if God had not freely accepted the praiſes which hee yelded vnto him, that they had byn nothing worth, as wee haue already declared: but we haue of this here a ſufficient and manifeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What is the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why Dauid beſought God to accept the praiſes which he re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred vnto him? he did it not like an hypocrite. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth then, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee preſented him ſelf before God, to magnifie his name, that hee might very well haue byn put by, &amp; his mouth to haue byn ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. And why ſo? bicauſe that we profane the name of God ſeing there can proceede nothing but filth &amp; ſtench, from thoſe which are altogether corrupt, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there be any one drop of goodnes in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And although God hath put in to them any good vertues, yet they are ſo entermedted with vices, as that it is lamentable. And therfore Dauid knowing this to be ſo, praieth God that his praiſes might pleaſe him. Now if Dauid knew his vnworthineſſe to be ſuch, I beſeech you, dareth any of vs to ſay, that we are of our owne power capable, to magnifie the name of God, &amp; to re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der him ſuch tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes as to him appertaineth, without he of his meere free good wil alloweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not imputing vnto vs the vices and imperfections which are therewithal entermedled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7694:125"/>he wil alſo thinke wel of our praiſes and thanksgiuing, yea although they deſerue it neuer a whit? And beſides, if wee need to deſire God, to accept our praiſes which we render vnto him: I pray you what ſhal become of the reſt? For it is moſt certain, that if ther be any ſeruice which pleaſeth God, it is euen this whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come to do our homage for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we haue receiued at his hands: and that we confeſſe &amp; proteſt that we haue nothing but that we hold of him. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as wee doo this homage vnto God; loe this is the ſeruice, which he chiefly deſireth of vs: Loe this is that ſweete ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſacrifice, which the ſcripture ſpeaketh of. Now ſo it is, that when we would do this homage vnto God, therby to humble our ſelues, yet may it be amended: in ſuch ſorte as that we deſerue to haue it to be put by, &amp; to be diſalowed: what ſhal then become of our other meane ſeruices, and in effect, of al our whole life? Shal we now go and glorify him with our merites as the Papiſts doo, who lift vp their heads againſt God with an whoriſh ſhameleſnes: For they thinke that GOD is beholden too them: or elſe, although they haue offended his maieſtie, yet after that they haue rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened with him, they thinke that they may very well reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe him with their ſatisfactions. Go too now, let vs think thus of our ſelues, that when wee ſee that in the very beſt &amp; moſt requiſite, yea and as it were the very flower of all our good workes, euen of thoſe wherein God guideth vs, that they do nothing elſe but ſtinke, except God himſelfe clenſe them too make them ſweete, and taketh from them the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities and filthineſſe which are in them. Nowe if of all our good workes, yea euen of the moſt excellent we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to craue pardon of God for them, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of our groſſe and ouer manifeſt ſinnes whereof wee are conuinced, and whereof men, yea, and yong children, may reprehende vs? So then, ſee here an excellent place, which rightly aboliſheth al vayne and diueliſh confidences, wherewith we deceiue our ſelues, when as wee thinke too ſtande before the maieſtie of God with our merites, and ſuch other like gewgawes and trifling toyes I knowe not what thinking thereby to recompenſe him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:126"/>
            <p>And thus much for this verſe. Now Dauid afterward ſaith,</p>
            <q>
               <l>My ſoule is always in my hand: yet do I not forget thy lawe.</l>
               <l>The vngodly haue laide a ſnare for me: but yet I ſwarued not from thy commaundements.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here Dauid proteſteth as before, that he had ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute affection to followe the woorde of God, as that no temptations could withdrawe him from it. And ſee how we may ſay, that we ſerue God, without hypocriſie &amp; in truth. For if we be eaſily and gently dealte withall, ſo we haue no affliction, that our God handleth vs as wee would wiſhe, &amp; leaueth vs to our owne pleaſure, or els, if he ſo much fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, as that we are not preſſed with any griefes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes: it is an eaſy matter then for vs too ſerue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. But when God afflicteth vs, that it ſeemeth hee would oppreſſe and grieue vs euery minute of an houre, when we ſee death purſuing vs on euery ſide, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are wholy about vs, as it were ready to pull out our eyes, and our life ſo wretched; as that the world iudgeth vs to be as it were reprobates: when then al theſe temptations ſhall touch vs, and yet we remaine ſtill conſtant prayſing of God, and holding vs vnto him, perſeuering in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and calling vpon him, beeing patient in all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, vntill ſuch time as he deliuereth vs: when we haue all this, we may then ſay with Dauid, that we haue diſplaied and layde wide open our life to ſerue God: and this ſhall be a good and ſure profe thereof. But if we haue not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, a great number may make a wonderfull ſhewe of godlineſſe before the face of the worlde, but all that ſhall proue nothing. And ſo, let vs well conſider of this place: for Dauid ſpake not this for him ſelfe, but for our common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And beſides, if we will in deede profit our ſelues by this doctrine, let vs conſider that if we ſometimes ſee the apparaunt dangers of death, ſo that wee be preſſed downe on euery ſide, not to thinke it to be any ſtrange thing. And why ſo? Bicauſe the ſame came too paſſe as greatly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Dauid. For he ſaieth that he was not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall trouble. My ſoule (ſaieth he) is alwaies in my hand:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7694:126"/>my life is as it were I can not tell where, it is put foorth to abide all miſchiefe, that it ſeemeth I were at deathes doore euery minute of an houre. If Dauid was alwayes thus troubled, and yet perſeuered in the prayſing of God: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ought not we to bee aſhamed to be faint harted, when as it ſhal pleaſe God to exerciſe vs onely but now and then? Euen ſo, although afflictions oppreſſe vs, yet muſt we not ceaſe too fight againſt them, attending and crauing the helpe of God. And thus much for this. And beſides, when wee are thus aſſured, let vs ſeeke our comfort where it may hee founde, that is, in the woorde of God, and to be thus conſtant neuer to forget the lawe of God. Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſider and obſerue this doctrine. For it is not without cauſe that Dauid ſayeth, That although my ſoule bee in my hande, yet haue I not forgotten thy lawe. Hee ſheweth vs heereby, that as wee are weake, ſo we ſhoulde be ſoone ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and in the ende throwne downe, when as wee ſhoulde ſee our ſelues laide wyde open to death. Wee then hauing this vnderſtanding ought to ſtand vpon our guarde, to the ende the diuell might neuer beguile vs, vnder the coloure, that God had as it were forſaken vs, and that we ſhould be as it were in the ſhadowe of death. Moreouer, we ſee what doltiſhneſſe (or rather beaſtlineſſe) this is amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes, to take this place for proofe of freewill. My ſoule is in my hand to wit, I am able of mine owne nature, and of my owne proper ſtrength, to diſcerne betweene good and euill: and to do whatſoeuer I thinke beſt. If brute beaſtes could ſpeake, they would ſpeake a little wiſelier then thus. For to what purpoſe ſhould Dauid ſay, although, O Lorde, that my ſoule is in my hande, yet haue I not forgotten thy lawe? He ſhould altogether ſpeake cleane againſt nature. But as we haue already declared, this is a kinde of ſpeeche much vſed in the ſcripture, to ſay that the life of a man is in his hande, it is as it were in the winde, or I know not where. Let vs now come vnto the proteſtation which he addeth,</p>
            <q>The vngodly haue laid a ſnare for me: but yet I ſwarued not from thy commaundementes.</q>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:127"/>
            <p>This ſentence is like vnto the other which we are about to handle. For hee ſheweth howe his life was in his hande: too witte, that ouer and beſides the afflictions which were directly ſent him from the hande of God, that the wicked alſo perſecuted him aſwel: and beſides the violences, and outrages, that were doone vntoo him, hee had alſo ſecrete ambuſhes laide for him. See then howe diuerſly hee is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and yet he neuer ſhronke from the lawe of God. In the ende he addeth and ſaith,</p>
            <q>Thy teſtimonies haue I claymed as myne heritage for euer: for they are the very ioy of mine hart.</q>
            <p>Nowe heere hee ſheweth, howe he was able to remaine firme &amp; conſtant without being withdrawne by any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: but that hee alwaies ſtood ſtedfaſtly in the lawe of God: that is, bicauſe hee alwaies choſe it for his heritage, that is for his chiefe felicitie. For this worde <hi>heritage,</hi> in the ſcripture, is taken for the thing that man moſte deſireth, and that which moſte properly belongeth vnto him. To be ſhorte, it is ſuch a ſimilitude, as that is which is ſpoken of the Treaſure: as if a man ſhoulde call it, the ſouereigne good, the true and perfect felicitie. See then at what ende wee muſt beginne, if in the middeſt of death we wil abide ſo conſtantly as Dauid hath doone, too keepe the lawe of god: that is I ſay, to chooſe it for our inheritance. And how is that? Firſt of al we muſt vnderſtande, that al the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities wherevntoo wee are ouermuch giuen, are tranſitory, without certaintie, and without propertie. For wee may want them euery handewhyle: neither can wee enioy any thing be it neuer ſo iuſtly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that we may be robbed of it betwixt this day and too morowe. What is then the ſureſt felicitie which wee can haue, and may enioy for euer? it is euen the woorde of God. And this is it which wee ought chiefely too deſire, and wherein wee are eſpecially too reioyce. Lo then how wee muſt vnderſtande that which Dauid heere proteſteth, That hee hath choſen the woorde of God for his heritage.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:7694:127"/>
            <p>Yea and he ſetteth it downe by and by after, that it hath beene the very ioye of his heart. For vntill ſuch time as wee haue had this taſte in the woorde of God, that wee truely ioye in it, it is a ſigne that we neuer yet had any good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereto at all. Although wee haue knowne that our chiefe felicitie lieth therein, yet are wee not able well too keepe our ſelues in it, vntill ſuch time as wee haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that it is that wherein wee muſt delight, and in none other thing.</p>
            <p>Nowe it is impoſsible that wee ſhould euer take any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or pleaſure in the lawe of God, except we did knowe that he declareth him ſelfe to vs in it, that hee is our father, and taketh vs for his children, that wee haue a teſtimonie that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs, that wee may haue acceſſe vnto him, and hee able to call vpon him in all our neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If God ſayeth onely vnto vs, loe what it is that I would haue you to doe, I would haue you too take mee for your God, &amp; to ſerue me with all your heart: if we haue but theſe two tables, to looke into, to knowe what wee haue to doe, ſhall the lawe of God delight vs? No, but contrariwiſe, it ſhall feare vs. We ſee then very well when Dauid ſayth, that hee tooke all his delight and pleaſure in the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God, that he had not ſimply the bare worde of the lawe, to ſay that God commaunded him that which he ought to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that he alſo ioyned the promiſes thereto, bicauſe that God willing his children to come vnto him, promiſeth to make them feele his goodneſſe and fatherly loue which hee vſeth towardes thoſe that are his. To bee ſhort, he ſheweth them that all their felicitie conſiſteth in his onely mercie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſaieth in the ende,</p>
            <q>I haue applied mine heart to fulfill thy ſtatutes always: euen vnto the ende.</q>
            <p>Nowe when he ſayeth, that he enclined his heart to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the commaundementes of God: he ſheweth vs, what ſeruice it is that God requireth: that is a voluntary &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeruice. See here yet a point which ought well too bee conſidered off, too the ende wee ſhoulde not thinke
<pb facs="tcp:7694:128"/>that we are euer able to pleaſe God, when as wee ſerue him conſtrainedly, as wee ſee the miſerable and wretched faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe do, which greatly torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. And why ſo? For all that they do, they doe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrainedly bicauſe they would the better eſcape the hande of God, but when they come neere vnto him as well as they may, it is but as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and conſtrained, bicauſe he is their iudge. Nowe if we haue ſuch a conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deſire (as we terme it) that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to do that which wee are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: our whole cace is little worth, and God will neuer allowe of it. And why ſo? bicauſe he liketh of nothing els but of obedience, and woulde haue vs come vnto him with franke and willing mindes.</p>
            <p>See then why Dauid ſaieth, that hee hath inclined his heart to keepe the commaundements of God: not that he proteſteth, that he hath done it of him ſelfe, nor of his own minde:but bicauſe that God hath giuen him both the will and the power to do the ſame. And to proue it to be ſo, wee ſhall neuer ſee that Dauid braggeth of him ſelfe in any one place, that he willed any good, being ſo led of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per minde:<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> he will neuer ſaye, that it was his naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but ſaieth cleane contrarie, <hi>I was conceiued in ſinne,</hi> ſaieth he, he reſerueth nothing to him ſelf but al that which is naught. When then in this behalfe he proteſteth that hee had inclined his heart, he onely ſheweth what the grace of God was in him. And for concluſion he addeth: <hi>That he did it for euer, or, euen vnto the ende,</hi> or, this is it which we haue touched heretofore: to wit, we muſt be like ſuddaine blaſts which paſſe by and by, but wee muſt bee conſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that when we ſhall haue once begunne, we muſt pray vnto God that he will continue the ſame our well doing which hee hath begunne in vs, and to holde vs by the hand vntill ſuch time as we haue finiſhed our courſe. After he had ſayde, <hi>for euer,</hi> he addeth, <hi>euen vnto the ende.</hi> It is very true, that the ſaying which hee here vſeth, importeth ſometimes, ſalarie Or rewarde: But in this place (as in the firſt verſe of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7694:128"/>
               <hi>HE,</hi> he vſeth the ſelfe ſame ſaying) it ſignifieth but too the ende: as if hee ſhoulde haue ſaide wee may alter and chaunge our mindes in other thinges: but we muſt follow vnto the death, when God calleth vs vnto him, beeing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that in this purſuite wee cannot ſayle to come to the true ende, without to fayle and erre for euer.</p>
            <p>And according to this holy doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God in acknowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our faultes: beſeeching him that it woulde pleaſe him too make vs ſo throughly too feele them, as that wee may in all humilitie bee able too craue pardon of him for them, groaning for all the offences which wee haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him. And that in the meane while alſo wee may haue recourſe vntoo him, beſeeching him too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy all our vices and imperfections: and ſo too confirme our weakeneſſe, as that beeing ſtrengthened by him, wee might ouercome all the temptations wherewith Satan can any way aſſayle vs, that beeing more &amp; more confirmed in his holy dictrine, wee deſire nothing els but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte our ſelues vnto it, and too bee ſquared by none other rule, but by that which he hath giuen vnto vs through his word. That it woulde not pleaſe him onely to graunt vnto vs this grace, but vnto all people and nations of the world. &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſo many lettes and ſtoppes both from aboue and heere beneath which drawe vs on to doe wickedly, or at leaſt wiſe which cauſe vs too ſlacke our ſeruing of GOD, that which ſoeuer of vs that is minded to doe well, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him al his wicked &amp; euill affections, and all the temptations, which any waye may come againſt him. See then why Dauid in this place, meaning to proteſte that hee loued the lawe of God, ſayeth to the contrarie, that hee
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7694:129"/>hated high enterpriſes, or rather wicked and crooked ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, euill conſiderations. For the worde which is here touched, ſignifieth a bough or braunch: and by a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude taketh it for the euill and wicked imaginations and deuiſes of men which, runne this and that way. Now we ſee what a bottomleſſe depth the ſpirite of man is, and how he wreatheth or windeth him ſelfe in his fantaſies. This ſelfe ſame word ſignifieth, the very height and toppe either of an hie hill, houſe, or any other hie thing. And therevpon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as by a ſimilitude, the imaginatiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipts of men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they entend to bring them ſelues into credit, and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to aduaunce them ſelues, euen as ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ruleth our nature, vntill ſuch time as God hath tamed vs by his holy ſpirite, and humbled and made vs gentle and meek. And now that wee may haue the true and naturall meaning of this place, let vs ſee in effect, that Dauid proteſting that he loued the law of God, ſaieth, that hee remoued quite from him whatſoeuer might withdrawe him from it. Nowe hee ſpeaketh not this here to the ende to bragge of him ſelfe: but rather that this example ſhoulde bee for our better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the ſpirite of God hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it by his mouth to the ende we might vnderſtand and knowe, which is the meane whereby we might be wholy giuen to the ſeruice of God, and to take holde of the lawe with ſuch an affection, as that our heartes might be as it were euen faſt tied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For it is impoſsible, I ſay, that wee ſhould euer come or attaine vnto it, vntill ſuch time as we haue cleane cut of the things which withdraw and turne vs away both on the one ſide and the other: to wit, al our owne fantaſies and luſtes: we muſt thruſt out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs all whatſoeuer, for the loue which we ought to beare to the lawe of God :we muſt alſo forget all hawtines or pride, yea euen ſtudying howe too ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelues from thoſe which any waye might drawe vs too euill: and not too communicate with the vngodly whiche are double hearted, full of hypocriſie, or elſe, ſuch as are but vaine glorious and of that pryde which euen moueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vp both againſt God and men:
<pb facs="tcp:7694:130"/>For their company will ſo corrupt vs, as that being uuzze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amongſt them, our heartes can neuer be ſo ordered and ruled in the loue which wee ought to haue to the lawe of God. Now then let vs kepe wel in mind this admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a thing moſt profitable for vs: to wit, as before I haue ſaid, that as we are enclined to committee a great number of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and villanies, which will withdrawe vs from the loue that we ought to beare to the word of God, let vs ſo much the mere flie from whatſoeuer draweth vs away backward. Yea and let vs vnderſtand, that looke howe many our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and affections are, that they are euen ſo many cartropes to hale &amp; pull vs away from this loue: or els, they are ſo many poyſons which Satan giueth vs, to the ende we ſhould not once taſte of the word of God, neither to be ſo amiable and pleaſant vnto vs as it ought: but rather that we might be greeued &amp; lothed therwith, &amp; ſo to leaue it, as if it were a grieuous matter, &amp; an occaſion of heuines. Since then it is ſo, let vs be well aduiſed too purge our heartes of all earthly affections, if we will take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to loue the word of God. And yet it is not enough that wee haue fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our vngodly luſtes, and fleſhly fantaſies, but we muſt alſo as it were gather our wittes together: for hardly can we open our eies to looke about this waye and that waye, but that Satan will laye before vs ſome euill and wicked ſtops and encountries. It is very true, that ſo long as we liue here in this worlde, wee can not but both ſee and heare a great many of things: but yet muſt wee bridle our ſenſes. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the reſt, we ought to fight againſt theſe ſtrange, &amp; counterfait hypocriſies and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherein we are nuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled. We muſt euen hate deadly al this in our heart, to the ende wee bee not hindred from the loue of the worde of God. And thus much for the firſt verſe. Now in the ſecond, Dauid ſheweth howe wee ſhould finde the woorde of God pleaſant and gratious, that we might loue it, that is, when as we ſhall truſt to his worde. <hi>Thou art,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and my ſhield: and I truſt in thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not added hereunto without iuſt cauſe. For if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7694:130"/>there be none other doctrine in the lawe but too ſay vntoo vs, Loe this muſt you do, wee can neuer bee comforted. For we ſhal find nothing in it but condemnation. When as god ſheweth vnto vs what our duety is, we muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and knowe, that before him wee are condemned and accurſed, ſeeing that no man performeth that which hee ought. So then, the worde of God ſhoulde bee both bitter and grieuous vnto vs, if there were nothing elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in it but a rule too liue well: But when God is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie and witnes vntoo vs of his goodnes and mercy, and declareth vntoo vs that from him wee muſt looke too receiue our chiefe felicitie, that hee is preſt and ready too helpe vs, that the treaſures of his infinite goodneſſe are open vnto vs: when I ſaye, this ſhall be in vs, then may wee ſauoure and taſte his woorde, and conceiue the loue of it, when as we knowe that therein conſiſteth and lieth all our health and ioye. Nowe then, when as wee would profite in the worde of God, and exerciſe our ſelues in it, let vs learne to receiue the promiſes therein contained. And let vs not be like vnto them, which thinke that God ſaieth nothing elſe vnto in all the whole ſcripture, but doe this, or doe that: for then, this were a very thinne and feeble doctrine. For if God were there as a Philoſopher, to preache vnto vs of vertues, and to declare vnto vs, that we muſt be thus go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned: we ſhoulde haue but a pitifull colde pull of it: and bicauſe we are altogether and wholy contrary to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe of God, it is impoſsible but that wee ſhould bee grieued and troubled with whatſoeuer ſhalbe ſaid vnto vs.</p>
            <p>But I haue already ſhewed, that the principall matter which God declareth vnto vs in his worde, is this, that hee proteſteth howe well he loueth vs in alluring vs vnto him ſelfe, to the ende we ſhould not doubt, but that he will bee our father in all and through all, and that wee ſhoulde bee bolde to come before him: that when there is any queſtion of our ſaluation, and of whatſoeuer els we haue neede off, we ſhould not doubt but that hee is ready to heare all our prayers, that his hande is alwayes liberally bent, to the end
<pb facs="tcp:7694:131"/>to giue vs whatſoeuer we want. When we ſhall once knowe this to bee true, then, as I haue already ſaide, the worde of God ſhall bee pleaſaunt vnto vs. Loe nowe why Dauid by &amp; by addeth, <hi>My truſt is in thy worde, O Lord.</hi> This is alſo, in ſumme, our faith, which bringeth vs to the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God when I ſaye that it is faith which bringeth vs into the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God. I meane, that after we haue vnderſtood of his good wil, that we are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtirred vp to yelde our ſelues vnto him. And vntill ſuch time as hee hath imprinted in our heartes the teſtimonie of his loue, and the benefite which hee meaneth vnto vs, wee ſhall flye from him as much as may bee: and as often as this woorde of God ſhall ſounde in our eares, ſo often ſhall it grieue and torment vs, as wee ſee howe the faithleſſe doe feare, when the worde of God is ſpoken vnto them: it bringeth vntoo them nothing but terrour and feare, as if a theefe or murderer were brought before a iudge. But when as we haue faith to ſtay our ſelues vpon the goodneſſe of God, too call vppon him as Dauid doth here, our ſuccoure, and ſhielde: we may call vpon him with ſuch a confidence, as that hee will neuer bee deafe, too heare our prayers: when then wee are thus aſſured, wee are forthwith wonne to loue him, then delight we to yelde our obedience vnto his lawe. Nowe in following that which wee haue already declared, Dauid againe addeth,</p>
            <q>Away from me yee wicked: for I will keepe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of my God.</q>
            <p>Here hee ſpeaketh of the temptations which come vnto vs by reaſon of the vngodly who allure vs, as much as in them lieth too make vs too contemne God, and worke ſo many offences as that they breake all good order, yea, euen to leaue the worlde naked and bare of all goodneſſe. For ſo much then as wee are too liue here amongſt contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and outragious people, who haue neither fayth, truſt, nor truthe: and that theſe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations are very perilous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: as wee ſee what a great number of men are corrupt by them: Dauid ſaith, <hi>Awaye from me yee wicked, bicauſe I keepe the commaundements of my God.</hi> Here wee are to note, as before I haue touched, that hee ſpeaketh not this, too
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7694:131"/>make recitall of his worthineſſe, or that hee alledgeth it for his power and ſtrength to wynne him reputation: but ſpeaking by the ſpirite of God, he admoniſheth vs to liue holily: to wit, that if we will walke in the feare of God, and be vnder his yoke, wee muſt in the firſt place ſeparate out ſelues from the vngodly. Nowe this is an eaſie doctrine to be learned, but it is ſo ſlenderly practized of vs, as that we had neede better to thinke of it, then heretofore wee haue done. If there were a great number of offences in Dauid his time, which were to turne the faithfull awaye from the feare of God, and too leade them to doe wickedly, in what caſe then ſtande we nowe? It is very true that we are come to the full meaſure of all iniquitie. For if wee doe beholde at this day the ſtates and conditions of all men, it wil ſeeme that it is impoſsible for the world to be worſe, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſo poſſeſſeth both great and ſmall in townes &amp; villages, as that it is a very hell and tormentory to ſee it. Euen ſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, howe is it poſsible that a faithfull man can perſeuer to liue in the feare of God and in ſuch ſoundneſſe as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, without hee ſtande very ſure vpon his guarde? without he keepe a good watche? and chiefly except he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate him ſelfe from ſo great a number of corruptions? For at this daye a man can come in no company, but that the talke ſhall tende to the diſhonouring of God, with all vngodlineſſe: or els the talke ſhall bee ſo vaine, as that it ſhall haue no good ſauoure, yea, and too make whatſoeuer good ſeede that is in any man, who is yet teacheable, to bee nothing worth. And yet many times this ſhall not bee the greateſt miſchiefe: but a man ſhall heare the moſt curſed blaſphemies that may be vometed out by theſe grenning helhoundes at this day, who are growne to the full meaſure of impudencie, like vnto ſhameleſſe harlottes, diſcouering their vilanies not onely againſt God and all true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but doe alſo euen like maſtife curres barke againſt al religion. This we ſee, let vs then come to the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe which ſeeme to bee a little more tollerable, I beſeeche you what leſſon or fruite ſhall wee reape by them?
<pb facs="tcp:7694:132"/>We ſhall finde ſome of them to vſe aboundance of wicked traffique, craftes, deceiptes, or els outrages, violences, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions and cruelties againſt their neighbours. Another ſorte ſhalbe giuen to lech ery, and to ſuch beaſtlineſſe: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde ſhall bee gluttons and ſuch like brutiſh people of life and conuerſation? To be ſhort, turne which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we will, and wee ſhall finde nothing but corruption: ſo that if this doctrine hath beene any time neceſſarily to bee taught, it is at this moſt neceſſary and hie time, ſince wee are come euen to ſo full a meaſure &amp; bottomleſſe depth of iniquitie, let vs then be well aduiſed too departe from all thoſe that worke iniquitie, yea and let vs chaſe them farre from vs, if we will faithfully and truely ſerue God.</p>
            <p>It is moſt ſure that we muſt needes be conuerſaunt with the vngodly, or els departe out of this worlde at once: but yet we muſt not keepe them companie ſo familiarly, as too drawe with them the ſame yoke. Let vs take heede that wee in no wayes wynde our ſelues in with them: but that our life and conuerſation bee ſo ſimple and playne, as that they be neuer able to bring vs in, and to bee infected with their vices. For we heare what the holy ſcripture ſaieth, that we had no neede of any thing to corrupt good manners. For as a little leauen ſowreth the whole lumpe of dough, euen ſo when the deuill can thruſt in amongſt vs the leaſt drop of corruption, loe all ſhall be peruerted and come to naught. We ſee not at the firſt ſight howe the deuill goeth about to beguile vs, and therefore we ought to be ſo much the more watchfull. Let the vngodly complaine as much as they will, as wee ſee at this daye the murmurers and grudgers doe, that they thinke them ſelues to bee ill dealt withall, when as we will not be partakers of their filthines. Nowe wee knowe right well that they ſeeke none other thing but too make wicked, whatſoeuer is well ruled and ordered, too ouerthrowe whatſoeuer hath beene builded vp in GOD, and too bring ſoules too deſtruction. All this wee knowe. Nowe if any man keepe him ſelfe from this, here at they are all grieued.</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:7694:132"/>
            <p>Howe ſo? They ſay our company is eſchewed. Yea, but giue you the occaſion that you may be followed, ſeeke the right meane to giue your ſelues to God, and follow you the right way of ſaluation, and the better ſorte will not abſent them ſelues farre from you, but will rather ioyne with you. If they ſhall ſee you ready to march forward, they will ſay, Let vs goe togither: If they ſhall ſee you goe before, they will come after: if they ſhall ſee you tarry behinde, ſo that you be entred into the right way, they will ſtirre you vp too fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe them. But when as we ſee ſuch kinde of people to goe cleane backwarde from all goodneſſe, and deſire nothing elſe but to leade vs too wickedneſſe, yea too caſt vs downe hedlong with them into hell mouth, wherein to they runne like mad men, what ſhould we doe but ſeparate our ſelues from amongſt them, and retire vs from thence, as Dauid ſheweth vs. And namely he ſayth, <hi>For I wil keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of my God.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſayd, Theſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men doe right well ſhewe that they haue no feeling nor knowledge of euerlaſting life, but that they liue here like to brute beaſtes: Neuertheles for my parte I will not goe one foote forwarde with them, but will goe towards my God. And out of this ſaying we are to gather a good inſtruction, to wit that when we ſee rounde aboute vs all people giuen ouer to wickednes, that it ſeemeth the worlde hath conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make the maieſtie of God nothing worth, that wee declare by our lines and conuerſation, that wee haue no knowledge of euerlaſting life: when as then wee ſhall ſee ſuch impieties, it is euen to this end and purpoſe too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe vs quite and cleane from our God. It is very true, that theſe are very daungerous offences and temptations. But let vs alwayes be ſure to abide firme, and ſtedfaſt, let vs continue conſtant in this trueth which once we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. See then what Dauid meaneth to expreſſe in this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>My God.</hi> It is true that the faithfull will often ſay thus. But when there is any queſtion to make theſe compariſons with contrary thinges, the ſcripture vſeth not this ſaying, <hi>My God,</hi> ſo that it is to declare vnto vs, that nothing ought
<pb facs="tcp:7694:133"/>to make vs wauer: when we ſee the thinges confuſed in the worlde, when we ſhall ſee all whatſoeuer to be there peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ouerthrowne, that there is neither any more lawe nor order, that it ſeemeth vnto vs as it were an Hell, let vs not for all that bee ſhaken:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Abac.</hi> 1.12.</note> Let vs ſtande ſtill vppon our guarde, as the Prophet Abacuc thereof ſpeaketh, our faith muſt ſerue vs in ſteade of a Tower, wherein we keepe good watch, and yet too ſay notwithſtanding, no, no, God will tarry with me, and then I neede not to care for the whole worlde. See then that no temptations ought to quaile vs: being euen in cloſed amidſt the impieties and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the faithleſſe, ſeeing we cannot otherwiſe choſe but to bee conuerſaunt amongeſt them. It followeth nexte after,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſtabliſt me,</hi> or ſtay me, <hi>in thy worde that I may liue: and let me not be diſapoynted of mine hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Dauid proteſteth heere aboue, that he truſted in God, and that this hope proceeded vnto him from his worde: yet prayeth hee his maieſtie notwithſtanding too eſtabliſh him. Wherin he ſheweth vs, that we ſhal neuer haue ſo well profited neither in faith, nor yet in hope, but that there ſhalbe alwayes ſome want, and remnaunt of incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and weakeneſſe in vs, ſo that whenſoeuer there ſhall be any queſtion of comming to God, yet ſhall wee goe as it were halting vnto him. Now if Dauid hath made ſuch a requeſt, I beſeech you, haue not wee a greate deale more neede to doe it aſwell as hee? It is moſte ſure, that he neuer ſpake it hypocritically. When he ſaith, <hi>Vpholde me, or eſtabliſh me in thy word:</hi> this is not too make a ſhewe that his fayth was imperfect, and that hee needed not be ſtrengthened: no, not ſo, but he knewe well inough his owne infirmitie. If he then who was as it were an Angell of God, had need to profite in fayth, and in hope, and that hee had beene moulten, and beene quite conſumed had not God through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly confirmed and eſtabliſhed him: I pray you what ſhall we doe?</p>
            <p>So then, when as God ſhall haue already ſhewed vs this
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7694:133"/>fauour too bee ſurely grounded in his woord, ſo that wee are able to ſay that we truſt in it, let vs not ceaſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to continue this requeſt and ſay, O Lorde, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and confirme mee. For when wee ſhall well conſider our weakeneſſe, wee ſhall finde that a very ſmall thinge will quayle vs, if God holdeth vs not vp with his hand and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And afterwarde let vs conſider howe boyſterous the aſſaultes of Satan are, what violence he bringeth againſt vs: and are we euer able too withſtand them, if that wee bee not dayly ſtrengthened? They then which ſhall haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a true hope in the woord of God, let them knowe that they are yet but in the midde way, and that they muſt alwayes march furtherforward, vntill ſuch time as they are come to the ende thereof. Which thing ſhall neuer be, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they are vncaſed of this fleſhe, and are departed out of this preſent life.</p>
            <p>Seeing then wee cannot goe forwarde as of our ſelues, nor yet be ſtrengthened, without God aſſiſt vs: Let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him after the example of Dauid, that hee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs in his woorde. And afterwarde hee addeth and ſayth,</p>
            <q>That then he ſhall liue: and diſappoint me not, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> of my hope.</q>
            <p>When he ſayeth that he ſhall liue, It is to ſhewe vs, that all our felicities lyeth in this, that wee are thoughly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and fully ſetled in the word of God: When this ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ſo, let vs then feare no more. It is very true, that we ſhal neuer be but ſubiect to a greate many of myſeryes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions for it cannot be otherwiſe but that this life muſte be full of afflictions, and many griefes and vexations. Wee are then to fight whiles we liue in this worlde. And ſo wee ſhall finde a great number of miſeryes, and yet we ſhall not chooſe but to liue ſtill, when we ſhall bee throughly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon the woorde of God? that is to ſay, our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be ſure and certaine euen amidſt all the afflictions which may come vnto vs. And ſo ſhall wee haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be contented.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:134"/>
            <p>For vnder this woorde. <hi>to liue,</hi> Dauid comprehendeth all whatſoeuer concerneth the welfare and felicitie of men. He ſayth then, Although O Lorde, I ſhalbe taken as a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creature, and that in deede I ſhall abide many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which ſhall be greeuous vnto me: yet ſhall I haue true life and ſaluation, ſo I be thus eſtabliſhed in thy word. Now he addeth a little more, Let me not be diſapoynted of mine hope: wherein his meaning is to ſignifie, that God neuer ſuffereth his Children to be diſapoynted, when as they put their truſt in him; But yet the caſe ſo ſtandeth, as that wee muſt ſo beſeech him by reaſon of our weakeneſſe. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we truſt in God, yet for all that we goe coldely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and wee ſhall finde our faith to be alwayes too too weake and feeble.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, our hearte ſhalbe ſo ſhutte vp, as that the graces of God, as touching our ſelues, ſhall hardly water it by dropmeale. It is very true that God for his parte pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vppon vs his graces abundauntly: but we therein are nothing capable for the receiuing of them. Wherefore, wee are not worthy to taſt and feele his ayde in our neede, What ſhould this then be, if he ſurmounted not our hope, to help that which therein is wanting? And beſides we knowe that the Deuill would ſoone ouerthrow al our hope, were it not that it is very well kepte by an heauenly power, as alſo S. Peter maketh thereof mention.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</note> For when he ſpeaketh of faith, he ſayth not that men are the Gardians or keepers of it. For if that were ſo, it ſhould oftentimes bee violently taken from them. But that is a treaſure which God keepeth in his own hands, and that by his owne inuincible power and ſtrength. See alſo why our Lorde and Sauiour Chriſt in the 10. of Iohn, for our comforte ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. <hi>10,</hi> 24.</note> That the father who hath vs in his hand, and through whome wee are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him to be kept, is mightier and greater then they all. Accordingly then as wee knowe, the power of God to be infinite, ſo muſt we alſo aſſure our ſelues of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore it is, that wee are to require of God as Dauid hath done, that we be not diſapointed of our hope.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7694:134"/>Nowe in ſumme when we make ſuch requeſts, it is too the end that the promiſes of God ſhould be ſo much the more certaine and better ratified vnto vs. See then what God ſayth vnto vs. Feare you not when as you ſhall put your truſt in me, for I will nether deceiue, nor abuſe you, ne yet ſhall you be deſtitue of mine ayde: but be you aſſured that my hande ſhall alwayes be ſtreatched out too ſuccour you. We haue this promiſe made vnto vs which can neuer faile vs. Mow it behoueth that it be ratified and ſealed in out heartes. And how is that? That in our prayers and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we beſeech God to accompliſh and performe that which he hath promiſed, which ſhall be in ſteade of a ſeale ſealed within, to the ende we might haue ſuch a certaintie as is requiſite: and anon after God ſheweth in effecte, that he ſpeaketh not in vaine vnto vs. Loe, ſay I, what wee ought to note of the accorde that is betwixt the promiſes of God &amp; the prayers which we make vnto him in deſiring to make vs feele by experience, that he is faith full in what ſoeuer he ſpeaketh. Nowe Dauid by and by addeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holde thou me vp and I ſhall be ſafe: yea and my delight ſhall be continually in thy ſtatutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe the word which he vſeth, ſignifieth ſomtimes to meditate, ſometimes to ſpeake: &amp; therfore it may bee ſaid I wil recite ouer thy Statutes. But the moſt proper ſenſe &amp; meaning is, I will meditate or ſtudy in thy Statutes, and therein take delight. In ſteade that before he hath ſayd, <hi>Eſtabliſh me O Lord, or ſtay me in thy worde:</hi> Heere hee ſayth, <hi>Holde mee vp.</hi> Nowe this is no ſimple and plaine prayer which heere he maketh, but hauing ſpoken of the woorde of God, he ſpeaketh of the power which hee ſheweth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his faithfull? It is very true, that when wee thinke that wee haue not one foote of grounde too ſtand vppon, that there is nothing but the ſea vnder vs, and darkeneſſe ouer vs, that we ſhould be as it were in a bottomleſſe pitte, and ouerwhelmed: yet we ought to ſtay &amp; ſettle our ſelues on the worde of God. But when as our hope ſhall be thus cxerciſed, and that we haue doone God this honor, to hold
<pb facs="tcp:7694:135"/>him for faythful, although we do not perceiue any ſuccour to come from him: hee will adde a ſecond grace, to wit, he will giue vs his hand, to be releeued by his powre, and to be vpholden by him. and wil preſerue vs all the dayes of our life. Loe heere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meaning of Dauid, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God to ſtay him in his woord, he ſayth, Holde me vp, yea by thy hand and power. So then, let vs learne to to flye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, when as we would be in any good ſafetie. For with out it, as I haue already ſayde, wee may very wel for a while aſſure our ſelues: and thinke no euill can come vnto vs: But when as we ſhall be thus fooliſhly perſuaded, too ſay peace and aſſuraunce, deſtruction muſt needes ſuddainly come vpon vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.3.</note> and we to be vtterly confounded. But after we haue wayted and ſeene God too haue appeared in very deed, let vs learne to ſeeke all our aſſuraunce in his woord, to walke in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, to take our whole delight in them, and in them to beſtowe all our ſtudy. In ſumme, Dauid in this place declareth, That when as God ſhall haue beſtowed any benefites vpon vs, that wee haue prooued his mercie, and fatherly affection: It is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme vs more and more in his word, to tye all our ſenſes therto: to learne to forſake all vanities, which hinder and occupy our ſpirits in theſe wilde affections wherewith wee are carryed hither and thither. That we then beeing retired from them, might be inflamed with ſuch a zeale as Dauid was to meditate in the commaundements of God, and in them too take our whole delight. Nowe it followeth,</p>
            <q>Thou haſte troden downe all them that departe from thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: for their deceiteis vaine.</q>
            <p>Heere in this place Dauid conſidereth of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God, which hee executeth vpon the wicked: howbeit we are not alwayes able to perceiue them. For we ſhall oftentimes ſee (as it were againſt all Gods forbod, as wee ſay) the wicked to beare aucthoritie, and in ſuch ſorte to triumph, as that they think it cannot be poſſibly amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7694:135"/>and ſuppoſe them ſelues to be the moſt bleſſed people in the worlde. And then for the while we ſhall ſee all things goe cleane againſt the haire. But after that the Lorde God ſhall long time paciently haue abidden all theſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of his mercifull louing kindeneſſe: it cannot bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen but that at the laſt hee muſt vtterly deſtroy them. And ſo let vs conſider not too be ſo blockiſh as too forget the iudgements of God: but let them rather inſtructe vs after the example of Dauid, to walke in his feare and to loue his Commaundementes.</p>
            <p>Now he ſay thin the firſt place: <hi>Thou haſte troden the vngodly vnder foote, and all them that departe from thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, for they imagine but deceite,</hi> ſayth hee. He addeth one reaſon, which we ought throughly too weigh: For what is the cauſe that the vngodly hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not vnto God, &amp; ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt him beyond all meaſure: For if at any time GOD mooueth them too repentaunce, through the admonitions of his woorde, they doe nothing elſe but ſcoffe and laugh at him: yea they are ſo ſhameleſſe, as it is pitifull too ſee? What is the cauſe of this? It is becauſe the wicked haue their heartes faſte ſhutte vpp in their backe warehouſes, thinking thereby to beguile GOD, too eſcape his hand through their ſtarting holes, and ſubtile deuiſes, and they ſeeing them ſelues too be braſen faced, to couer their villanyes before men, thinke that they ſhall eaſily inough put of the plagues and puniſhmentes of God.</p>
            <p>See howe the wicked doe increaſe in their willes, that they are euen come too this poynte that they feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of what ſoeuer they ought too bee affrayde. And this is it why the Prophet Iſaiah alſo ſayth,<note place="margin">Iſaiah.</note> That they digge Caues in the earth for their defence, thinking that when their eyes are ſhutte vppe, that their ſinnes ſhall be no more ſeene, and that God ſhall not bee able too finde them. Accurſed bee you (ſayth hee,) which thus digge deepe pittes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:136"/>
            <p>Now Dauid ſayth in this place, that all the ſubtiltie of the vngodly is nothing elſe but vanitie. It ſhall bee forſooth to great purpoſe for them, when (as they thinke) they ſhall through their hypocriſies ſhroude them ſelues and couer their wiles and ſubtilties: yet ſhall their deuiſes bee but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for they ſhalbe taken in the tripp, as it is ſayde in the other place, yea and in the ende ſhall be faſt ſhutte vp in all their deceits and inuentions. Heerevpon he ſayeth,</p>
            <q>Thou haſt taken away all the vngodly of the earth like droſſe: therefore I loue thy teſtimontes.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid declareth vnto vs in breefe by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That when God puniſheth the Godleſſe, he layeth his hand vpon them, in ſuch ſort as that we may perceiue that he ſheweth him ſelfe to be their Iudge, to the ende that wee thereby ſhould be the rather ſtirred vp too loue his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemens, and to be ruled by them in beſtowing al our deſire and affection vpon them. See then howe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and corrections which God layeth vpon the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to profite vs. And this is it why Saint Paule in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the faythfull to walke holyly, and to abſtaine from all pollution ſayths,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.6.</note> 
               <hi>Take heede that you be not beguiled through vaine woords: For, for ſuch thinges the wrath of God commeth vpon the children of diſobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is true, that before God hath executed his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes we ought already to be inſtructed too walke in his feare. But when God ſheweth vs openly howe he putteth to his helping hand, it is good reaſon that wee ſhould be ſo much the more attentiue to his Iudgements.<note place="margin">Eſa. 59.17.<hi>18</hi>
               </note> And loe why the Prophet Iſaiah ſayth, That when God executeth his Iudgementes, that the inhabitantes of the earth might learne, that he dooth it righteouſly. Moreouer, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how ſlack we are to come vnto God, that hee is faine to drawe vs perforce vnto him. Ought not we euen to run vnto him, ſo often as he lifteth vp his finger vnto vs? So of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he ſhall open his holy mouth to inſtruct, and ſhew vs the way of ſaluation, ſhould we ſlacke and deferre it from day to day? But what? Marke the peruerſneſſe, and that not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7694:136"/>only of the moſt wicked, but euen of the holyeſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt which are infected with this vice. See what Dauid ſayth, that he had neede to be pricked forward like an Affe: yea euen Dauid himſelfe, who was the moſt forwarde of all other according to the graces which he had receiued. If it hath ſo fallen out with him, by reaſon of the reſte of the imperfection which he had, that hee was ſpurred, and his fleſhe pricked like an Aſſe: what ſhall become of vs which haue ſcarcely receiued one drop of the ſpirit of God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and compariſon of this holy mane?And ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider to be the more watchfull ouer our ſelues ſo often as God ſheweth vs any token that hee is Iudge, and calleth the vngodly to an accounte: that at the leaſte we be ſtirred vp to run vnto him for refuge, and to loue his word. Nowe in the meane time, to conclude Dauid addeth,</p>
            <q>My fleſh trembleth for feare of thee: and I am afraide becauſe of thy iudgementes.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid ſetteth downe two things which ſeeme at the firſt ſight not to agree togither: For it may bee ſayde, that this feare whereof he ſpeaketh can no way agree with the feare of the commaundements of God: but yet there is a ſweete hermony betweene the one and the other. And why ſo? For as the faithles in fearing God wax deſperate, &amp; are ſo thrown down, that they can neuer haue that boldnes to come neere vnto him: Euen ſo on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſide, there is a frank &amp; free feare in thoſe which are gouerned by the ſpirit of God, which beareth a reuerence vnto his woorde, to make them tremble before it. For by the iudgementes which Dauid heere ſpeaketh of, he meaneth not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely which God executeth, but nowe hee treateth as he doth throughout the whole Pſalme, either of Statuts or elſe of ordinaunces? which are to direct our life: as alſo the Prophet Iſaiah ſaieth, that the faithfull tremble at the voice of God: that they conceiue his incomprehenſible maieſtie in his word, and thervpon are humbled: But yet they ceaſe not for all that, too come boldely vnto GOD, knowing that he wil be their mercifull father and deſireth
<pb facs="tcp:7694:137"/>nothing elſe but to receiue them. This humble feare then, may well be conioyned with the loue of God, agree with faith, and with a taſte which we might take in the worde of God, in giuing our ſelues wholy thereto. But the feare, which ſerueth to none other ende but to aſtoniſh the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which onely feele an hell in their conſciences, and yet haue no taſte of the grace of God: this feare I ſay ſerueth to none other purpoſe, but to ſhut vpp the gate againſt theſe miſerable accurſed people, without all hope of ſaluation. Now Dauid ſpeaking of the feare of the word of God, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to a deeper and a more weightie conſideration. For his meaning is to ſhewe vnto vs, how that God is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sauiour, and that he freely draweth vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as already he hath declared.</p>
            <p>According to this holy doctrin, let vs proſtate ourſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging our offences, beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him too make vs to feele the ſweeteneſſe of his worde, as his ſeruant Dauid hath beene thereon throughly ſetled: too the ende we might haue ſuch a feruent affection to it, as that it might cauſe vs to forget all the deſires of this worlde, wherein wee are too too much plagued: and that wee might cut of all the ſuperfluties of our fleſh: to the ende we might be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in all holineſſe vnto our God, and to be confirmed more &amp; more in his ſeruice. And that being once brought by him into the way of ſaluation, although we muſt walke in this world, becauſe we are compaſſed about with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daungers: yet that he will alwayes ſtretch forth his hand vnto vs, to keepe and hold vs in his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the end. That hee will not onely graunt vs this grace, but alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all people and nations of the worlde, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE holy Scripture often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times admoniſheth vs, that if wee will haue God to ſtand with vs againſt our enemyes, wee muſt walke perfectly and ſoundly: For if wee will bee like the wicked, rendering euill for euill, it is in vaine for vs too hope that God will be on our ſide, either yet fauour vs: But it is meete that he be iudge on both partes,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:138"/>when as they incline thus to doe euill. Would we haue God to be our warrant and defender? Doe we beleeue that hee will haue compaſſion on vs, when wee are troubled and violently oppreſſed? Let our conſciences be pure &amp; cleane before him, becauſe we knowe that hee taketh vppon him ſelfe this title, too be the maintainer of all thoſe which are vniuſtly oppreſſed, and alſo of the miſerable and afflicted. Now if we haue ſuch wicked hearts, to inforce vs to wicked dealing, how ſhall God put foorth his hand too ayde vs? For then muſte hee intermedle himſelfe with a naughtie cauſe: which is an impoſſibilitie, and altogither contrary to his nature. See then wherefore it is ſaide in this place,</p>
            <q>I haue executed iudgement and iuſtice: giue me not ouer vnto mine oppreſſors.</q>
            <p>Dauid heere maketh a requeſt vnto God, that he might not bee deliuered into the handes of his enemyes which ſought to deſtroy him. Nowe for the obtayning of that which he demaunded, he maketh this proteſtation, That hee hath walked rightly before God, yea, euen with them which went about to deſtroy him. Moreouer theſe twoo wordes, <hi>Righteouſneſſe and Iudgement:</hi> when they goe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, importe aſmuch as too doe wrong too none: but too proceede in equitie, and in good fayth (as we ſay) for too maintaine euery good cauſe, and not to ſuffer any wronge to bee doone: For it is not inough for vs too abſtaine from hurting and greeuing of our neighbour. Neither is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for vs to goe aboute to diſcharge vs of our dueties: But when wee ſhall ſee any man vniuſtly troden down, and a good cauſe goe too wrack, wee ought too oppoſe our ſelues againſt euery ſuch wicked acte and iniury, and as it were to take parte with God, who as he is the commender of all equitie, ſo will hee alſo haue vs to maintaine it foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we are his children. We ſee then in ſumme, the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtation which Dauid heere maketh, that is, that he did not only abſtaine from hurting his neighboures, &amp; go about to render to euery man, that which was his: But ouer &amp; beſids al this he ſet himſelf againſt al violences &amp; extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7694:138"/>were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, he would not ſuffer the innocent to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to be put forth for a pray or ſpoyle, but payned him ſelfe to doe what in him lay to helpe them. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may be bolde too make ſuch a proteſtation in trueth, Let vs not dout but that God will ſtretch foorth his hand: that if men went about to trouble vs, yea and that wee were as it were in great daunger too fall into their hands, Let vs not doute but that God will haue pittie on vs and ayde vs. For this Prayer which Dauid heere maketh was not made at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but the holy Ghoſte put it into his mouth, to the end to teach vs to walke (as he hath doone) ſo ſoundly &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. And heerevpon, if men ſhould lifte themſelues vpp againſt vs, and vſe all the outrages and malice they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, Let vs haue recourſe vnto God, &amp; be aſſured that he will be our defendor and protector.</p>
            <p>Now we very well ſee by this, that Dauid made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his merites vnto God, as if he ſhould haue ſayde, I haue right wel deſerued, O Lord, that thou ſhouldeſt keepe and defend me againſt the wicked, becauſe I haue doone that which is lawfull and right. Dauid ſpake it not too any ſuch end. But he had regarde (as I haue already ſaid) to the goodneſſe of God and to his promiſſes which are contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the lawe, and imprinted in his heart: too wit, That God will vpholde all thoſe that are vniuſtly troden down, and alwayes helpe thoſe which are outraged and iniuryed: Becauſe that they for their parte haue taken great paine to be at peace withall the world: that they haue not giuen oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for any to greeue and torment them, and yet that the vngodly haue ryſen vp againſt them. See what a regarde Dauid had. Nowe he addeth,</p>
            <q>Anſwere thou for thy ſeruant in that which is good: and let not the proude doe me wrong.</q>
            <p>The ſaying that Dauid heere vſeth, ſignifieth ſometimes a man to giue his woord, as we ſay in this countrie: that is, to become a mans ſuretie, and his pleadge, and ſome there are which doe ſo expound it: but the true ſenſe and moſte
<pb facs="tcp:7694:139"/>naturall meaning of it is this, that Dauid prayeth that hee might be giuen to doe good and to delight therein. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee ſee this to be a woorke of GOD, and a grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him, when we ſhall deſire too be giuen too doe good, ſo that we haue pleaſure in it, and doe taſte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For this is very certaine, that notwithſtanding that men followe the very inclination of their fleſh, to hate the good and loue the euil: and when any thing ſhall be tolde them of God, we ſee howe it maketh them Melancolique and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull. So then, it is God that muſte chaunge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs, or elſe we ſhall neuer attaine to this affection here ſpoken of, to take pleaſure in wel dooing, and ſo to loue it.</p>
            <p>Nowe Dauid was no hypocrite, too make a faire ſhewe, to deſire a thing at the handes of God, which was in his owne hand: But he knewe this too be the manner of men, that it was impoſſible for him to come to the ful perfection of that, except it were giuen vnto him from aboue. See heere in ſumme, what we haue to learne and keepe by this. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he addeth that the wicked (or the proude) outrage againſt him, he ſheweth that when we ſhall be ſo giuen too well dooing, we muſt truſt too the protection of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which I haue already ſaide. Let vs alſo note that Dauid in this verſe confirmeth the matter already handled. He hath heeretofore very well ſaid, O Lorde, I haue done the thing that is lawfull and right: and yet hee ceaſeth not to beſeech God too graunt him ſuch courage and ſtrength. And howe is that? Forſooth, that he woulde increaſe it in him, &amp; giue him the grace to ſtande ſtedfaſtly therein vnto the ende. We ſee then, that whenſoeuer wee ſhall be the moſte deſirous in the worlde, to followe ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie &amp; equitie: we muſt vnderſtand for all that, that we may yet be amended, and that we are nothing neere that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is requiſite.</p>
            <p>Wherfore it remayneth that we deſire this performance with the graces that Dauid hath heere demaunded: Thy graces O Lord, had neede to increaſe in vs, graunt vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may come too the accompliſhment of them.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7694:139"/>Wee haue O Lorde walked purely ſo farfoorth as thou haſt giuen vs the power: But wee flye vntoo thy promiſes: to the end thou mighteſt make vs to perſeuer in well doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. See, I ſay, how wee ought too craue the thing at the handes of God which he hath already giuen vs, and that we haue receiued from him: that is, that it woulde pleaſe him to conſerue and increaſe it, conſidering that we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre from ſuch a perfection as is moſt requiſite: in ſuch ſorte as that wee neuer decline from well dooing, which we ſhould doe if he ſhaked his hande. See then too what end this petition tendeth which is heere placed.</p>
            <p>Nowe we muſt turne againe to the matter, to wit, that Dauid heere repeateth, that they which haue beene thus perfect, &amp; haue loued well doing, ſhould be vnder the hand and ſafegarde of God, neuer to be deliuered into the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their enemyes, ſo that the proude ſhall neuer be able to doe them that excceeding great wrong which they had pretended: Not that they ſhall not be aſſayled, neither yet that the wicked will not craftely goe about to worke them miſchiefe: but yet ſo, as that God will be their buckler, and defend them with his mightie power. And namely hee ſayth, <hi>The proude.</hi> Becauſe that they which are our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and make warre againſt vs, haue ſuch an vnbrideled libertie, as that they thinke neither God nor yet any other liuing creature is able to ſtay them, but that they will bring to paſſe whatſoeuer they haue determined. Since then it is ſo, that we haue too deale with ſuch kinde of people as are both ſtout and cruel, who lifte them ſelues vpp againſt all trueth, that neither the feare of GOD, nor yet natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall honeſty can ſtoppe them, but that they will deſtroye whether it be right or wrong as we ſay: for this cauſe Dauid ſayth, <hi>O Lord let not the proude doe me wrong.</hi> And ſo as often as we ſhall ſee this boldeneſſe in men, to lift themſelues vp, and to vomit out their peſtilent malice againſt vs, let vs flye vnto GOD, and beſeech him too holde his holy hande ouer vs, &amp; to repreſſe ſo great and inſolent arrogancie. This beeing done, although men for their partes make ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:140"/>yet ſhall they neuer bring them to paſſe: For God will holde them back, as it were with a ſharpe brake.</p>
            <p>Nowe if this petition came euer in ſeaſon, it commeth nowe at this day in very good ſeaſon. For wee ſee how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the enemyes of God are which bend themſelues againſt the Goſpell: wee ſee the malice and obſtinacy throughout the whole worlde. And ſo, it is not poſſible but that a man which feareth God muſt needes be aſſayled &amp; troubled on all ſides. Seeing then that men are ſo furious to wrong vs, ſo much the rather ought we to be carefull to make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt vnto God with Dauid, yea and that with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, as that we ſhould not doubt but that when wee are vnder his protection, he ſhall bee ſufficient too maintaine and defende vs. Nowe it followeth:</p>
            <q>Mine eyes haue fayled in looking for thy ſaluation: and for thy iuſt promiſe.</q>
            <p>We ſhall not neede to ſtande long vppon this ſentence, becauſe it hath beene already handled heere before. Dauid onely proteſteth, that he hath looked for ſuch helpe from God, as he deſired. And that is to ſhewe, that he prayed not hypocritically, but faythfully. And this is a thing which we ought throughly to marke. For wee thinke our ſelues too haue doone very ſubſtancially and ſufficiently, when as wee haue pronounced and rightly placed our words in the time of prayer; but if wee ſhall haue ſpoken neuer ſo loude, and with neuer ſo full and open mouth, and yet haue emptie or faſt cloſed vp heartes, emptie I ſay, and voyde of all truſt and faſt cloſed vpp, it is a moſte manifeſt token that wee neuer ſurely looked for any ſuccour at the hands of God: and therefore beholde why of very right all our prayers are vnprofitable and to no purpoſe. And ſo, when as wee wil beſeech the Lord our god to take our cauſe into his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to help vs, let vs take this with vs which dauid here ſheweth in this place by his example: to wit, let vs attend and looke for our ſaluation and deliuerance from God: Yea and let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of that which is ſaid, &amp; according to the word of thy righteouſnes. For by this he ſignifieth to vs, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7694:140"/>muſt looke and caſt our eyes, when as we would throughly ſtirre vp our ſelues vnto ſuch an hope: to wit, vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which God hath giuen vs: for if this be not in vs, it can neuer be ſaid to be any more hope, but a vaine imagination which we haue forged too our ſelues: for to hope or truſt in God, is to be eſtabliſhed in his promiſes. For if a man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a thing which ſeemeth good in his own ſight, &amp; after, leaneth thereto, this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truſteth not in God but in him ſelf. So then, if we looke to haue any help at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of God, we muſt haue a ſure teſtimonie of his will, we muſt be ſure that he loueth vs, and that when he loueth vs, hee will not fayle vs in our neede. And how ſhal we be aſſured of this? It ſhalbe by the onely meane of his worde. Nowe bicauſe men are ſo hard to be brought to reſt them ſelues vpon God, and not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent them with his promiſes, Dauid ſaith theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be iuſt, according to the word of thy righteouſneſſe, ſaith he, It is not in vayne that hee thus intituleth the word of God. And why ſo? For he thinketh that if he haue but his bare worde, that it is enough for him. And why ſo? For God maketh not vnto vs liberall and large promiſes as men doe, and then deceiueth vs. His wordes are iuſt. And as he ſaieth in an other place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6.</note> his wordes are like to pure ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which is tried in the fier, and hath beene ſeuen times purified in the furnace. Euen ſo is it with all the promiſes of God, we ought to be very aſſured of them. Bicauſe hee is faithfull and iuſt, and that there is nothing but righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and truthe in all that he ſayth. Now Dauid goeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on for he ſpeaketh not of a ſimple affection: But ſaith, that his eyes haue fayled, as if he ſhould haue ſaid, that he was hardly ſo reſolued and not without great paine. By this hee ſheweth vs, that his faith was ſo troubled, as that hee knewe not what would become of him, that hee had great and ſtrong conflictes, that he was in marueilous anguiſhes, &amp; troubles, ſo that he was as a man halfe dead: and yet that he was armed and fenced amiddeſt al theſe hard caſes, with the hope &amp; truſt which he had in God. See what the words import which he vſed, that his eyes fayled for the health,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:141"/>and ſuccoure, which hee looked for at the handes of God. Will we then haue a right hope, and ſuch an one as God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of? Let vs then not truſt onely when wee are quiet and at reſt, ne yet be throwne downe by any temptations: but when as we ſhalbe in our extreameſt troubles that wee know not at all what ſhal become of vs, that we ſhal ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but death before vs and round about vs: here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſay, let vs alwayes be firme and conſtant, truſting that God will be our ſauiour, ſince he hath ſo promiſed vs. Loe howe we may make this proteſtation as Dauid here doeth. Nowe it followeth,</p>
            <q>Deale with thy ſeruant according to thy louing mercies: and teache me thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>Here it may very wel ſeeme that Dauid maketh two peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but yet they tende both to one ende. For in the firſt part of this verſe, he ſheweth, how he deſireth, and truſteth to be heard: to wit, through the meere mercy of God. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, O Lorde, teach me thy ſtatutes: and teach mee them, not for that I thinke my ſelfe worthy of them, but bicauſe thou art pitifull and knoweſt my neede, and haſt promiſed alſo to helpe all thoſe which call vppon thee. Deale then, O Lorde, with thy ſeruant according too thy mercie, to the ende thou mighteſt teache me. By this we ſee that, which I haue already touched: to wit, that this verſe conteineth not two petitions, but one onely. And yet notwithſtanding Dauid ſo ſetteth it forth, in declaring that when he commeth to God to praye him to teach him, that he doeth it not to the ende that hee preſumeth of his merittes, neither yet to make vaunt that hee deſerueth any thing of him. Wherefore then? Forſooth bicauſe hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and truſteth to the meere mercy of God. And in very dede, this is a farre more precious thing then that which Dauid here demaundeth, to be taught the ſtatutes of God, to ſay that it hangeth not vpon our merites, neither yet of any worthineſſe of ours. It is a queſtion to know the way of euerlaſting life, and wherein it conſiſteth &amp; lieth. It is very meete then that God do it, bicauſe he is pitifull: that he vſe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7694:141"/>his goodneſſe towardes vs, and looketh to none but vnto him ſelfe, bicauſe he is good, and that it pleaſeth him to put to his helping hand to thoſe which are his. Now although he hath here ſpoken of an excellent thing, yet of all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions which wee make, were they the leaſt in the worlde, we alwaies ought to laye this foundation, yea, and to ſtaye vpon it, that is, vpon the mercie of God. If we ſhould onely demande but a droppe of water or a morcell of bread, wee muſt not thinke too obtaine, by reaſon of our deſert, as if God paid vnto vs our wages: but his mercy muſt alwaies go before, for that is the cauſe why we receiue ſo many benefits at his hand, and eſpecially that we are taught his ſtatutes.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth, <hi>I am thy ſeruauant, graunt me therefore vnderſtanding: that I may knowe thy teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a more large expoſition of the verſe going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: he hath ſaid, O Lord, deale with me according to thy mercies, &amp; now he ſaith, I am thy ſeruant. And how is this? it ſhould ſeeme that there is ſome diuerſitie betwixt theſe two ſayings. For doth not Dauid in calling him ſelf the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, ſet downe before, what ſeruice he hath done him? Nowe let vs note that for the firſt place that it is not ſaid for any bragge, nor that hee was ſo able a man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto any ſuch worthineſſe, neither yet that he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be preferred before others: hee meaneth not that this honour apperteined vnto him of right. What then? It is as much as if he had ſaid, O Lord, I am thine. Now, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it of our ſelues, that wee are the ſeruauntes of God? haue wee obtained this eſtate, or degree as of our ſelues? Alas it is very farre of: for we haue it of free gift. Since the time that we were the bondſlaues of Satan, God hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs vnto him ſelf, to be of his houſhold and of his number. In that then that we are his, it is not bicauſe wee haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, but bicauſe hee hath called vs vnto him of his free mercie and goodneſſe. And in deede, if a man who was firſt of a baſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, ſerueth a noble man, he will not ſay that he was worthy of the ſeruice of ſuch a maiſter, nor yet that he was put vnto him therefore: but wil thus ſay, ſir, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that you haue receiued me into your ſeruice of your meere
<pb facs="tcp:7694:142"/>fauour and grace, and haue done me the honour which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteined not vnto me. And thus ſhould wee moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched wormes of the earth ſay, Loe God, who ceaſeth not ſtill to do vs good: and yet we will bee ſo arrogant, as too determine to attribute vnto our ſelues I know not what, as though he had herein nothing to do with vs. Nowe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you tell me whether is this to goe? And that which is more, let vs conſider a little, what ſeruice it is that God might drawe and plucke out from vs, to doe vnto his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. If he ſhall leaue vs vnto our ſelues to bee as wee are, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what ſhall he employe vs, and what ſeruice can we do him? For loe, both wee and all that is within vs are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giuen to wickedneſſe. Wee cannot once thinke any good: how ſhall we then do any? Next of all, Dauid mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, that hee beeing called to ſerue God, was able too diſcharge himſelfe thereof: for he felt him ſelfe vtterly vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do it. And ſo as touching this place, we muſt not thinke that he meant to make any vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſeruice which he had done to God, but it is as much as if hee had ſaid, O Lord, thou haſt ſhewed me that fauour and grace too bee one of thy number, and haſt receiued me into it, through thy bountie and goodnes. I beſeeche thee therfore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame thy goodneſſe and too heape grace vppon grace in me, as in that behalfe thou art wonted to do.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come vnto his petition. He ſayeth, <hi>O graunt me vnderſtanding, that I may keepe thy teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We haue already ſaide, that hee handled that which he had lately ſpoken. For by theſe wordes he meaneth, that we ſhould be alwayes like beaſtes, vntill ſuch time as God had opened vnto vs the ſpirite or vnderſtanding of humaine things. Wery well, yet ſhall we learne them according too our naturall diſpoſition. It is very true, that it ſhalbe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch meaſure, as God ſhall therein giue it vnto vs: but yet it is as it were after a naturall maner. Moreouer, when wee ſhall talke of the ſecretes of the heauenly life, &amp; of the wiſedome which God ſheweth vnto vs in his worde: there muſt all men confeſſe, that all their ſenſes faile them,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7694:142"/>and that all their reaſon is dead and buried. What is then to be done? Let vs come to the remedy which Dauid here giueth vs: to wit, that we deſire of God to haue vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that we might become very wel learned. For without that, we muſt continue and remaine ſtill in our beaſtlineſſe. And this prayer anſwereth and wery well agreeth with that which we haue ſeene in the verſe next before, as that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath beene already touched. Now it followeth ſoone after.</p>
            <q>It is time for the Lorde to laye to his hand: for they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thy lawe.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid maketh a petition againſt the contemners of God, and tranſgreſſers of his lawe: ſaying, That it is time for the Lord to lay his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſince that he ſeeth his law to be ſo deſtroyed, that there is no accompt made of it. It is very true, that Dauid greatly deſired the conuerſion of all men, and by little and little their ſaluation. And it is no doubt but that hee prayed too God with a good affection, that it would pleaſe him to bring to repentance all thoſe which he ſee to bee lead vnto wickedneſſe but yet hee was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this zeale which wee ſee in this place: that is, that God would execute his iudgements vpon the obſtinate, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thoſe which were altogether ſtubburne. And ſee alſo howe we ought to temper our affections, that when we ſee men go to do miſchief, let vs haue compaſsion vpon them: if we ſe them giuen to ſinne and wickedneſſe, if we ſee them to be in the way of perdition, let vs trauell too bring them againe into the right way, to procure their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as in vs lieth, and we ought to deſire and to pray for it, haue we had any ſuch affection? Then let vs neuer ceaſe to pray vnto God, to ſtretch forth his hand vpon thoſe his enemies whom he knoweth to be altogether deſperat. It is very true we muſt not condemne them: But wee ought rather, as I haue already ſaid, to vſe the effect of charitie towardes all, and pray vnto God that he would ſaue them: but bicauſe there are a great number which are ſtubburne and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amendement, we ought to beſeech God, to ſhewe him
<pb facs="tcp:7694:143"/>ſelfe a iudge ouer thoſe whome hee knoweth to bee ſuch. And why ſo? Bicauſe they drawe the ſimple and ignoraunt vnto wickedneſſe, and are an offence vnto them, bicauſe alſo they make the worde of God to be euil ſpoken of, and are the occaſion that libertie is giuen to al euil. When then we ſee the name of God to be euill ſpoken of, that there is no reckening made of his word, that all doctrine is caſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfoote, we are to praye vnto him to remedie it. It is time, ſaith he, for God to lay to his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for they haue deſtroyed thy lawe, O Lorde. He here ſpeaketh in the third perſon: &amp; after directeth him ſelfe to God. And why doth he ſo? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that this order is not alwayes to bee obſerued, that he which prayeth vnto God is to continue in one ſelf ſame perſon: yet it is ſo, that in this place, it ſeemeth that Dauid meant to ſpeake with a greater vehemency, when he ſayth, O Lord, lay to thy hand. As if he ſhould haue ſhewed, what the office of God is: for if hee had ſimply ſaide, It is time O Lord, that thou diddeſt looke vnto the matter, bicauſe thy lawe is deſtroyed: this had not beene ſpoken with the like vehemencie, as when he ſaide, it is time that thou O Lorde, lay to thy hande: for by this ſaying, hee declareth what the office of God is: to wit, to be iudge of the worlde: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth him to lay foorth his iuſtice, in puniſhing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and horrible wickedneſſes committed here below: that after he had ſuffered them a long time, he deſireth him to prouide for the puniſhing of all thoſe which had beene ſo obſtinate, and hard hearted againſt him. Now by this we are admoniſhed, when as we ſee that the law of God is as it were vtterly caſt vnderfoote, his doctrine to be a reproche amongſt men, and all right and equitie ouerthrowne, ſo that there is nothing but confuſion throughout: that then we ought to pray vnto God the more earneſtly, to the end it might be known that he doth his office. If this euer were neceſſary, it is at this preſent moſt neceſſary. For let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eſtate of the world I beſeeche you, what hauocke is there made of the lawe of God? Are wee not come to the very extremitie, to contemne all doctrine of ſaluation?</p>
            <p>When God at this day ſpeaketh vnto vs, what eare giue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7694:143"/>we vnto him? and how reuerently? See heere, hee hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vppon vs a ſingular grace at this daye, when as his worde hath beene once againe publiſhed. Let vs beholde our vnthankefulneſſe? Let vs lay all theſe things together, and we ſhall ſee that the maieſtie of God his woorde is no more eſteemed then the very pyll of an onion, as wee ſaye. See I pray you too what a point wee are growne and come: euen vnto ſuch an horrible and brutiſhe impietie as is moſt lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table. Moreouer, let vs looke into the maner of our life and the order of gouernement: ſhall we finde either iuſtice, loyaltie, reaſon, or modeſtie? no: but cleane contrary, wee ſhall ſee the whole ſtate of our life, and order of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, full of treaſon, malice, crueltie, and violence: al full of blaſphemie againſt God: plentie of drunkenneſſe, glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and diſſoluteneſſe: ſtore of lecherie and all other vyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies whatſoeuer: To be ſhort, it ſeemeth that the whole world hath conſpired to exceede euen vnto the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of wickedneſſe. When then wee ſee the lawe of God to be thus ouerthrowne euery maner of waye, ought not wee to giue our mindes a great deale more then wee doe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche God to take order, &amp; to prouide for the ſame. Now when we ſhall haue ſuch a zeale to pray vnto God, as wee ſee that Dauid had, let vs not doubt but that he wil remedy all the confuſions which we ſee to be at this day. And now he concludeth, and ſayeth,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Therefore loue I thy commandementes: aboue gold yea aboue moſt fine golde.</l>
               <l>Therefore I eſteeme all thy commaundements moſt iuſt: and all falſe waies I vtterly abhorre.</l>
            </q>
            <p>See here what a notable proteſtation he maketh, &amp; ſuch one as we ought throughly to marke. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dauid hath ſaid here before, that the wicked haue deſtroied the lawe: yea, &amp; ſpeaking of no ſmall number of men, but as of all in general, ſeeing al the world to exceede &amp; to be corrupt: hee addeth for this cauſe, O Lord, I haue loued thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, aboue all gold, yea and aboue moſt fine gold I haue loued them in all &amp; through al, &amp; haue vtterly abhorred all falſe wayes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:144"/>
            <p>Nowe I haue ſaide that this is an excellent proteſtation, conſidering the circumſtances. For if Dauid had dwelt amongeſt the godly faithfull ones, which had ſerued God, and walked in his feare: then it might haue beene ſaid, that it was an eaſie matter for him to haue conformed him ſelfe vnto them. For although we ſee men alwayes enclined to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, yet they are many times reduced and framed to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe through good examples. But I pray you in what time was it that Dauid liued? Forſooth in ſuch a time as that he was compaſſed with the deſpiſers of God, hee ſee nothing but following of euill throughout the worlde, hee ſee as it were a madde and diueliſh impietie, he ſee euery thing full of all infection: to bee ſhort, there was neither iuſtice nor equitie, no feare of God, nor yet any religion. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he ſaith, that he loued the word of God, and his commaundements, and that hee made more accompt of them, then of all the moſt precious things in the world. Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learne to loue the word of God, not only whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as wee ſhall be ſtirred vp by thoſe which keepe vs company to ſerue God all with one accorde: but alſo when we ſhall bee amongeſt peruerſe and frowarde people, that wee bee as it were in hell amiddeſt all the deuilles, yet to perſeuer in this affection, and not to leaue following of the worde of God: that whatſoeuer offences wee ſhall ſee committed by men, that they withdrawe vs not from the loue which wee ought to beare to the woorde of God. See then what wee muſt keepe in minde for the vnderſtanding of this text.</p>
            <p>And after, we are too note for the laſt verſe, that Dauid ſaying, that he loued the commaundements of God, ſaith not that he did it by halfes, as wee many times doe: but I, ſayeth hee, haue loued thy commaundements aboue all thinges. As if he ſhould haue ſayd, I am not like vnto thoſe, O Lord, which come to ſerue thee by halfes: but in all and through all, I loue whatſoeuer that thou haſt commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And after this maner it is that we muſt alſo do: for it is not in vs to deuide and make a partition of the worde of God neither yet can wee make it. And therefore, let vs bee
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7694:144"/>wel aduiſed to obey God, in whatſoeuer he ſhal commaund vs, and to loue his commandementes from the firſt too the laſt: and not to do as a great many do, which wil be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to receiue the Goſpel, forſooth, ſo farre foorth as it wil ſerue their turne and pleaſure them. Or els, if they paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this or that: and thinke themſelues to giue God greate credit, when as they ſhall giue him authoritie ouer them in ſome one point: But if ſoone after, they ſhall bee any thing grieued, they wil neuer ouerſlip that point. Neuertheles we are there admoniſhed too the contrary, that it is not for vs, as I haue already ſaid to make a partition of that which god hath conioyned: but wee muſt yeelde our obedience vntoo him euen to the ful: that although whatſoeuer he ſaieth or commaundeth vs to do, be hard and ſharpe too our nature, yet let vs take it in good parte with a gentle and mild mind: and ſay with Dauid, O Lord I haue loued thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which thou haſt giuen me, not in one, two, nor three points, but in al and through al. According to this holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, let vs humbly proſtrate our ſelues before the Maieſty of our good god, in acknowledging our offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him to make vs better to feele our miſeries, to the end we might be grieued with them and to ſeeke for remedy at his hands: That in renouncing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that is in vs, and whatſoeuer power and ſtrength wee thinke our ſelues to haue, let vs beſeech him to fortifie vs, and ſo to inlighten vs with his holy ſpirite, as that wee may more and more draw neare vnto him: And as hee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begunne to inlighten vs, that it would pleaſe him too cauſe vs to ſee his brightnes better than we haue don here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, vntil ſuch tyme as we ſhal come vnto his kingdome, where we ſhal perfectly ſee that which now we do but halfe know. And although this worlde be ſo peruerſe &amp; wicked, as that we might take occaſion to withdraw vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right way: notwithſtanding let vs beſeech him, that he wil alwaies vphold vs with a mighty and ſtrong ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to thend wee may ſtand ſtedfaſtly in that whervnto he hath called vs, &amp; neuer decline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it whatſoeuer came of vs. That it wold pleaſe, &amp;c</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in this firſt verſe of the eight, ſhould be a very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and common thing with vs. And in very deede there is no man but will confeſſe it to be true: but yet it is ſo very far of, as that there is none of vs al which hath the feeling thereof in him ſelfe: that is, that the lawe of God is a wonderfull wiſedome: for we doe ſee how it is contemned and deſpiſed. It is very true that God in all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7694:145"/>the holy ſcripture ſpeaketh ſharpely enough and alſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: but it is for this cauſe that he would fit himſelf to our ſimple capacities. And bicauſe that wee are blockiſhe and earthly, it is meete that he ſhould ſo plainely ſpeake as that wee might vnderſtand him. Neuertheleſſe, in this ſpeache, whcih carrieth no great glorie with it, ne yet is coloured with any worldly eloquence, are certaine ſecretes, which may very well rauiſh vs with marueilous aſtoniſhment. And in deede, the very cauſe why theſe faithleſſe, and comtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of God, ſo little eſteeme of the doctrine of ſaluation, is, for that they beeing brutiſh, neuer taſted of that, which it meaneth to vtter. See then wherevpon this pride and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe ariſeth which wee ſee at this daye too bee in the greater parte of the worlde, ſo that there are very fewe which beare that reuerence to the woorde of God as they ought: for it is an olde ſaying, no man can loue a thing, before ſuch time as he knoweth it. They then which are ſo blockiſh, as that they haue neither ſenſe nor iudgement rightly to diſcerne of the truth of God, ſlippe it ouer, yea, and treade ſuch an ineſtimable treaſure as it is vnder their feete. But they which haue once knowne, what it is that God teacheth vs in the holy ſcripture, may very well ſaye with Dauid, that they are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful things, and ſo high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries as that we ought to wonder at them, &amp; doe deſerue that euery one of vs ſhould wholy apply his mynd thereto. Nowe he ſayeth, <hi>That for this cauſe his ſoule did keepe the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of God.</hi> This importeth a greater matter, then if he had ſimply ſayd, I haue kept them: for he ſignifieth that he hath kept them (as we ſay) with an hartie affection. And loe, howe indeede, we ought to eſteeme of the doctrine of God: it is not onely to haue an opinion, that it is excellent, and worthy to be had in ſoueraigne and high honour: but that we ſhould be very earneſtly touched therwith that we might haue ſuch a feare and an obedience rooted in our heartes, as that the ſaying of the Prophet Iſaiah might bee fulfilled in vs, that we might tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at the voice of our God. Loe here in effect the content of the firſt verſe, of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:146"/>eight, which we are nowe about to handle: that is to ſaye, that the faithfull whoſe eyes God, hath opened, might knowe, that the holy ſcripture conteineth no common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but ſuch a wiſe doctrine as is worthy to be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and honoured all the world ouer. Nowe when as we ſhal once haue knowne that God layeth wyde ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly myſteries in his lawe, it is good reaſon that wee for our part be touched, &amp; moued to hearken vnto our God when he ſpeaketh vnto vs: yea and that in ſuch ſort, as that he handleth no ſmall and light matters, and of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but openeth vnto vs his myſteries, which are farre beyond our reach and capacities, except that of his infinite goodneſſe, hee bare vs that fauoure too fit him ſelfe to our vnderſtanding. Now Dauid addeth in the ſecond verſe:</p>
            <q>The entrance into thy wordes, ſheweth light and giueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding vnto the moſt ſimple.</q>
            <p>Wherein he ſignifieth, that if we vnderſtand not all the myſteries of God which he ſheweth vnto vs in his worde, we muſt not ſtraightwayes therefore ſay, that the doctrine is vnprofitable vnto vs. Why ſo? Bicauſe the onely ſauoure which we ſhall feele therein ſhall profit vs. It is not nedeful that wee bee great clarkes nor perfect doctors to receiue ſome benefire and edifying from the word of God: for we can not haue ſo ſmall an entrance into it, but that wee ſhal become already both wiſe and well aduiſed. Loe here in ſumme the meaning of the ſecond verſe. And it is a place which we very well ought to obſerue: for like as there are a great ſort of people which make no accompt of the worde of God, bicauſe they neuer taſted of the myſteries therein conteined: euen ſo alſo there are ſome which excuſe them ſelues and ſay that the worde of God is too too darke and harde, in ſo much that it maketh them too flie from it, &amp; dare not come neare it.</p>
            <p>Alas will one ſay, I am a very ignoraunt ſoule, or, I am not ſo ſharpe witted as in deede a man would iudge: or els, I am but a ſimple ſcholler, and therefore can not conceiue of ſo high myſteries, Lo here what excuſes a number of men
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7694:146"/>will make, bicauſe they would not be acquainted with the word of God. No doubt of it we ſhall haue of thoſe people which will vſe ſuch excuſes and ſtartingholes, onely bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would be ignorant, and haue their eyes faſt clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp, although they haue the light of God too ſhine vpon them. Againe there are another ſort which will keepe them ſelues cleane away from the worde of God, fearing that if they ſhould once enter into it, that it would be like vnto a maze wherein they ſhould be held faſt in and ſo bee vtterly confounded. And therefore, let vs for this cauſe throughly conſider the ſaying of Dauid: to wit, that although wee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not vnto ſuch a perfection, as that wee are able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and know whatſoeuer is written in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to be ſo exerciſed therein euen at the full, as that nothing hath eſcaped vs: but let vs be throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the law, and haue the very true and vndoubted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and meaning of the Prophets, yea and let vs know and vnderſtand the Goſpel at our fingers endes: and yet although, I ſay we haue not attained vnto this excellency, let vs not for all this ceaſe to bee inlightened. Let vs then boldly approche, when as we ſee that God calleth and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth vs, and is ready to teach vs his word: and let vs know that when we ſhall haue neuer ſo little a taſt thereof, that it ſhalbe for our ſaluation, ſo that we ſhall not be altogether blinde, but that we may be able to know which is the right way vnto euerlaſting life. To be ſhort, we ſhalbe inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as Dauid ſpeaketh of in this place. And hereby we may ſee, what a great abuſe at this day raigneth in this point in Poperie, when as they ſhall put by the greater part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome from the reading of the holy ſcripture vnder a colour, it ſhould thereby be vtterly confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: and againe being neuer able once to come to haue any taſt therof, that it is ouer high a thing for them to meddle with. Now, this is to make the holy Ghoſt a manifeſt liar, who hath ſpoken &amp; pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the mouth of Dauid, that which we haue already heard, That the firſt entraunce into the woorde of God ſheweth light: in ſo much that ſo ſoone as we ſhal haue
<pb facs="tcp:7694:147"/>vnderſtoode but one onely ſentence thereof, the ſame to be already euen enough to leade and guide vs to euerlaſting life. Now ſithens then wee ſee how the deuill poſſeſſeth the Papiſtes, when as vnder ſuch a cloke, they withdrawe the ſimple people from the reading of the word of God, yea in forbidding it them with ſuch a cruell tyranny: let vs for our part, hauing ſo good and ſure a ground, take great heede how we wauer, and how we alwayes abide wittingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, conſidering that God hauing openly and at large ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infeſted himſelf vnto vs, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth ſtill more and more our good God, and giueth vs ſo great leiſure and large a time to profit in his ſchoole. And why ſo? Bicauſe then tree alone is cleare and bright: what will it then bee when as wee ſhall enter on ſomewhat further: that euen in the very entrance, we finde ſaluation? in what caſe then I beſeech you ſhall we be, when as we ſhal haue once paſſed the midway on? And to the ende that Dauid might the better expreſſe, that the queſtion is not here of the great learned doctors he name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaieth, <hi>That it giueth inſtruction to the ſimple and ſilly ſoules, to the ende they might haue light and vnderſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if he ſhould haue ſaid, that God hath ſo communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his word vnto vs, and in ſuch ſort framed and wrought it for our vnderſtanding, as that there is not the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; ignorant which ſhal not find himſelfe capable to bee the ſcholler of God, yea ſo that we come vnto it in all lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and humbleneſſe. For Dauid in ſaying that the word of God maketh the lowly to vnderſtand, right wel ſheweth, that if we come vnto it in the pride of our own minds, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of our own fine heads, as in this point a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of proud and glorious men doe, who wil rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troll God then ſubmit them ſelues vnto him &amp; to his word: no doubt of it wee ſhalbee left in the darke. For let vs not bee abaſhed although ſuch people of whome I haue already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken, do continually remaine moſt blockiſh. But wee for our partes ought to know, that we muſt be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled &amp; throwne down in ourſelues, to thend god might lighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. And then let vs not dout but that we ſhal feele God to be euer more ready to play the part of a good ſchoolemaſter vnto vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:7694:147"/>as we ſhal ſhew our ſelues to bee true and dutiful ſchollers. Now by and by followeth, <hi>I opened my mouth and panted:</hi> he was ſcarſly able to fetch his breath. And by this is ſignified the feruent zeale which he had, which was to be wel inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the law of God. Now here Dauid ſheweth, how it is that wee ſhould bee enlightened, that is, that after wee are knowne to be lowly and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, feeling our want and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie, let vs ſigh &amp; groane vnto the maieſtie of our God, in beſeeching him to inſtruct vs. For wee ſhall not neede to be greatly learned for our right and perfect walking, if wee truely and earneſtly deſire to be his ſchollers, &amp; to preferre his word before all other things. Dauid might very wel ſay, O Lord, I haue deſired to vnderſtand that which thou haſt ſhewed me by thy law, and yet contented not hee him ſelfe with this onely ſaying: But ſaith namely, that he opened his mouth, as a forepined ghoſt, who was no longer able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it. And afterward he ſaieth that he drew in his breath, that he was ſo zelous, as that it tooke away as it were his very ſpeach from him. There is no doubt that Dauid meant here the very ſingle affection wherewith hee was touched: not for any deſire he had to comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him ſelf, but to ſhewe vnto vs by his example what our office &amp; dutie is towardes God: that is, that we ſhould ſeeke too profite our ſelues by his word. Now then we haue here to note, that euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall be enflamed with the word of God, when as wee ſhall haue yea euen ſuch a vehement deſire, as hereof is mention made, and as hath byn before ſpoken off. That the word of God ought to be more deare and precious vnto vs then all the riches of the world, &amp; more ſweete then al other ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the earth. When then we ſhall haue ſuch a deſire as this, we ſhal finde God to bee alwayes ready to accompliſh that which is ſaide in the ſong of the holy virgin, that hee hath filled and ſatiſfied the hungry and empty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God wil ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie and fil thoſe that hunger after the thinges which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne but this preſent life. And do you thinke that when we ſhalbe deſirous of his doctrine, knowing it to bee the moſt principal benefite that we can poſsibly wiſh, &amp; whereunto we ought to apply our whole hart, that he wil let vs famiſh?</p>

            <p>Do you ſuppoſe that he will not graunt vs ſo holy a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſuch a one as he approueth aboue all the reſt? But by the way let vs conſider, that we perceiue not at this day, the profit and edifying which Dauid bringeth vnto vs in this place: bicauſe in deede we are ouer colde to ſeeke after the will of God. And to ſay truly, I beſeech you can we find one amongſt an hundreth which deſireth it, I ſay yea ſuch a one as onely hath that affection to be taught of God? We ſee to the contrarie, that wee ſhall not neede the very leaſt trifling toy to keepe vs at the gaze: bicauſe we are ſo full of all vanitie as is lamentable: neither can the deuill no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſet any thing before vs which wee will not runne after, and take occaſion to bee withdrawne from all whatſoeuer is good &amp; godly. Now then, when as we ſhall ſee our ſelues to be thus cold, is this to come with ſuch a feruencie, as is here declared vnto vs by Dauid? Alas where ſhall wee finde it? ought we not then euen to be abaſhed, when as we ſhal ſee ſo few to be truly taught of God? conſidering that ſo ſmall a number of people are touched to the quicke with a true deſire of his doctrine? But we ought rather to thinke it more ſtraunge, when as we ſeeing God to be ſo full of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnes, as too beare with our negligence that in ſteede of opening our mouthes, and to deſire his heauenly doctrine, as Dauid hath done, wee open our mouthes too craue ſuch things as do nothing els but offende and grieue the maieſtie of God: for in that is our whole delight, and vpon it beſtowe we all our power and ſtrength. When then wee ſhall after this ſort forſake God, and ſeeke after the tranſitorie things of this worlde, yea the which cannot but hurt, and leade into euerlaſting deſtruction, are we not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that God ſhould leaue and forſake vs as moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wretched caitifes? And therefore this doctrine is not heere ſet downe in vayne.</p>
            <p>Let vs then vnderſtande, that God meaneth here to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort vs by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Dauid, that if we wil be wel inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his worde, we ought with ſuch an humilitie as here
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7694:148"/>mention is made of, too come vnto him with an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire &amp; zeale, knowing this to be ſuch a benefite as deſerueth to be preferred aboue all the reſt, euen too knowe the will and loue of God towardes vs, conſidering that in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth and reſteth our whole ſaluation. Nowe it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the fourth verſe:</p>
            <q>Looke thou vpon me, and be mercifull vnto mee: as thou vſeſt to doe vnto thoſe that loue thy name.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid right well ſheweth, what the deſires and petitions of all the Children of God ought to be, to witte that they muſt hang vpon the meere mercyes of God, and to knowe that all their felicitie conſiſteth therein, and ſo to ſtay them ſelues vpon this ground and foundation, That God looketh with his eye vppon them, too guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them. Nowe this thing is greatly to be obſerued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that men commonly make them ſelues beleeue that they ſhall bee bleſſed, if they may obtaine that whiche their fleſhe deſireth. As when the Glutton ſhall haue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to fill his filthy paunch, ſo that it may ſtand aſtrout: the Whoremonger to inioy all his foule villanyes &amp; beaſtly lecheryes: the Couetous man to be ſo ſcraping as that hee careth not what he getteth nor howe he commeth by his goods, to lay Land to lande, and too bee filled with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans blood: Loe theſe are the men, as they thinke, which are bleſſed. Yea, and although they were not ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to wickednes, as openly to greeue the maieſtie of God: yet for al that ye ſhal haue very few which wil acknowledge them ſelues to be accurſed, but that God hath care ouer them and their ſaluation, &amp; that there is none other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe nor felicitie but euen this, that they are in the hand of God and vnder his protection. And ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought wee too recorde and haue often in minde this leſſon when as Dauid ſayth, <hi>O looke vpon me O Lord, and be mercifull vnto me.</hi> For by this hee ſignifieth vnto vs, that if we will haue our life to be bleſſed, if we will haue good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in all our affaires, Lo from this fountaine muſte wee drawe all our felicitie: which is the prouidence of God,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:149"/>becauſe we ſhould in no wiſe dout, but that he careth for vs, and beſtoweth &amp; imployeth himſelf for our preſeruation. When it is thus with vs, all the reſte cannot but goe well with vs: but if this point be wanting, we are very miſerable, although it ſeemeth to vs to haue euen aſmuch as can bee wiſhed. Nowe by the way let vs note, that Dauid in beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching God to be merciful vnto him, declareth, that ſo long as we are in this worlde, that we are ſubiecte too a number of calamities and afflictions. And ſo, we haue greate neede of the mercie of God, or elſe wee ſhall carry away all the blowes (as we ſay) amongſt ſo many greeuous encounters, as ſhall be lamentable. Nowe this may ſerue vs for twoo purpoſes: The one is, that wee being heere belowe vppon the earth, might make our account that we cannot be here as it were in Paradiſe, to haue ſuch reſte and quietneſſe as we would chiefely deſire, to lack nothing, and not to bee ſubiect to any griefe nor diſpleaſure: No, not ſo: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, let vs know that here God ſubiecteth vs to a great number of wretchedneſſes and miſeryes, to the ende wee ſhould be alwayes calling vpon him for his mercie, and too be alwayes running vnto him for it. Lo here the firſt point which wee are to conſider of in this place, that the faithfull to the outwarde ſhewe ſhalbe very miſerable, and in a moſt wretched caſe, ſo long as they ſhall liue heere bylowe: and the meaning of God is, to holde vs vnder this condition, to the ende to awaken vs, that we might haue a far greater affection to call vpon him, and to cleaue wholly vnto him.</p>
            <p>Now if we ſhall haue this conſideration with vs, we may then in the ſecond place ſay with Dauid, <hi>Haue mercie vpon vs O Lorde:</hi> that is to ſay, we may be aſſured in all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeryes; that God wil be pitifull and mercifull vnto vs, yea ſo that we deſire him, as we are heere taught too doe by the ſpirite of God. Namely Dauid addeth, <hi>As thou vſeſt too doe vnto thoſe which loue thy name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ſentence of Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which is here ſet downe: But it ſometimes ſignifieth, meaſure, ſometimes, eſtate, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or faſhion: the ſenſe is not darke: for it is aſmuch as if
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7694:149"/>he had ſaide, O Lord, haue mercy vppon me, euen as thou art wonted to haue mercy vpon thoſe which call vpon thy name. Now we are to gather from this ſaying, that Dauid made not this petition only for himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but hath ſet down vnto vs a general rule, which we may and ought too apply vnto euery childe of God, too the ende that euery one for his owne part might be ſure that God wil haue mercy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and ſtretch forth his hand to aide him in his neede. And why ſo? For the holy Ghoſt namely pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth, that it is the ordinary maner of God to be louing and pitiful to al thoſe which loue his name. What remayneth then for vs to do? Forſooth we muſt loue the name of God. And heere we are alſo to conſider, what this ſaying meaneth, too loue the name of God: For wee ſhal haue ſome men which wil feare god, ſo, ſo, and yet be contented neuer to come neere him, if they could otherwiſe chuſe: yea they wil not ſticke to ſhut the dore againſt him, and kepe themſelues as far from him as is poſsible.</p>
            <p>Nowe Dauid ſheweth heere vnto vs, what the true feare of God is to wit, that we muſt loue him of our owne good wil, and that with reuerence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not conſtrainedly to loue and feare him, but that we deſire too come vnto him, and wholy to ſubmit our ſelues vnto his Maieſtie. If we ſhal do thus: then may we truly ſay that wee loue him, &amp; in louing him, feare him alſo. In very deed, theſe are things that may not be ſeparated, bicauſe it is impoſsible for vs rightly too reuerence God, and to feare him as we ought, except (as it is ſaid in the Pſalme) that we firſt acknowledge him to bee our father, loking for al goodnes and courteſie from him. This then affoordeth vs, in the firſt place, that wee are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that God loueth vs, that wee muſt take him as for our father, that wee feele, that hee in the louing of vs, deſireth nothing els but our ſaluation. And thus much for the firſt point. And after from thence alſo proceedeth, humilitie: whenas wee ſee GOD ſo too abaſe himſelfe, as too ſeeke for vs myſerable Creatures, wretched wormes of the Earth, yea euen very condemned and vtterly loſte
<pb facs="tcp:7694:150"/>perſons, the bondſlaues of Satan, That God ſeeketh for vs euen in Hell, and draweth vs ſo louingly vnto himſelf. And muſt it not needes be that we are very ſtubborne, if we bee not touched, and mooued to come vnto him, and yeelde our ſelues vntoo him, and bee ruled and gouerned by his hand and protection? Loe, ſay I, how wee ought to loue the name of God, to the ende we might be glad of that felicitie which Dauid heere ſpeaketh of, that is, that God looketh to keepe vs through his prouidence. And although wee are heere compaſſed with a great number of miſeryes, afflicted a great number of wayes, and iudged to be moſt wretched, yet God is at hand to help our neceſſities. And namely it is ſayd to loue the name of God, Becauſe wee muſt receiue a teſtimony from him, to comprehend his good will. Wee ſee not God in his Eſſence, or as he is in deede, but he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth himſelfe vnto vs by a nother meane: to witte, that wee might beholde him in the glaſſe of his woorde, where he ſheweth himſelfe vnto vs openly inough. Nowe Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid addeth ſoone after,</p>
            <q>Order my ſteppes in thy woorde: and let no wickedneſſe haue dominion ouer me.</q>
            <p>Heere wee ſee more cleerely that, which I haue already touched: to wit, what the petitions of the faithfull ought to be, to the ende they ſhould not be giuen to vaine things, For we neede not to haue any thing to make vs by and by to goe aſtray, ſeeing our owne nature draweth vs readyly inough thereto. There is no queſtion, but that wee wil go more then a foote pace, when as wee are bent too doe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: yea we will trot on moſte ſwiftly and violently, euen as wretched men that were bewitched. Wherefore, heere is a remedy ſet downe vnto vs: conſidering that our nature is inclyned to all euill, and caryeth vs thereto headlong, that we only ought to indeuour our ſelues too bridle our vaine and wicked affections: and beſides wee ought too deſire God to keepe vs through his woord, and not too ſuffer any iniquitie too reigne in vs. Loe, I ſay, in what ſorte all the faithfull muſte order them ſelues, fighting againſt all their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7694:150"/>fleſhly luſtes: For it is meete that wee vtterly renounce the euill that is in vs, if wee will ſeeke after God and come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Nowe heere are two things which Dauid deſiereth, To haue his ſo oteſteppes ordered according to the worde of God: And afterwarde, that no iniquitie haue dominion ouer him. Which is aſmuch as if hee had ſayde, That God had conformed him to his word, and giuen him power and ſtrength to withſtand all temptations.</p>
            <p>Nowe when he ſayth, <hi>Order my ſteppes according too thy word:</hi> he meaneth, that we can doe nothing at all, excepte God gouerneth vs by his holy ſpirit. So then, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that we haue the woorde of God preached vnto vs, to heare it, and to be exerciſed in the reading thereof: But it is God that muſt put to his helping hand ouer &amp; beſids: he it is that muſt make the preaching of it effectuall, and pearce our eares, to the ende wee might vnderſtande that which is ſet downe vnto vs, and open our eyes when wee reade, and that altogither by his holy ſpirit. And thus much for this. For although we haue the woorde of God offred vnto vs, yet ſhall wee profite nothing thereby vntill ſuch time as God giueth vs vnderſtanding to ſee it. And beſides, it is not inough to haue the knowledge of the will of God, and to vnderſtand the right way to ſaluation: But God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt leade vs him ſelfe, and holde vs by the hande euen vnto the ende. And why ſo? For we will neuer ceaſe draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward, when as God ſhall haue faithfully inſtructed vs, if ſo be he himſelf doth not ſtil conduct vs, and alwayes holdeth vs with a ſtronge and mightie arme: becauſe that our rebellious nature will neuer ceaſe too withdrawe vs cleane contrary. For Saint Paule, who had ſo greatly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the feare of God, and was ſo very forwarde therein as the like was not in his time, yet ceaſed hee not ſtill too ſay, <hi>I ſee two lawes in my ſelfe: I haue a deſire to ſerue God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19.</note> 
               <hi>but yet there is another thing alſo which leadeth me to the contrary, ſo that I doe the euill wich I abhorre, and would not doe: and if I doe any good, it is not doone with ſo cheerefull an affection as I would.</hi> See heere in what ſorte Saint Paule complayneth
<pb facs="tcp:7694:151"/>him ſelfe, and in the ende concludeth and ſayeth: <hi>Alas moſt wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me out of this priſon?</hi> If Saint Paule vſed this kinde of ſpeech,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.13.14</note> what ſhall become of vs, when we ſhall be no whit guided by the ſpirit of God? I beſeeech you what ſhall the bare doctrine profite vs? It is meete then, that after God ſhall haue taught vs, that hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo guide vs, &amp; after, that he giue vs the power and ſtrength to followe him, and too confirme, imprint and engraue his lawe in our heartes, as alſo it is ſufficiently ſette downe in the ſcripture touching the ſame.</p>
            <p>Dauid goeth forward and ſayth, <hi>Suffer not any iniquitie to haue dominion ouer me.</hi> To what end and purpoſe ſaieth he this? For he had before deſired God too order his ſteppes, to the ende he might ſerue him in true and faithfull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Forſooth it is, becauſe that when God hath beſtowed his grace vpon vs, to be deſirous too cleaue vnto him, yet ſhall we neuer come to the ful ende there of without greate afflictions, hauing ſo mightie an enemie to ſtand againſt vs as we haue. It is very true that we deſire nothing elſe but to be made teachable of God, and to ſuffer our ſelues to be gouerned by the great Paſtor or Shephearde Ieſus Chriſte: this is already one good ſteppe: but let vs a little better con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider, wherefore ſuch grace profiteth vs not. It is becauſe the Deuil commeth ſoone after too ſet it on fire, for hee alwayes findeth good ſtore of Woode in vs according as we are ſtored with many vices and imperfections in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vntill ſuch time as God ſhall haue wholy taken vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of this fleſh. For all our luſtes and affections are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rebellions againſt God, as that wee neuer ceaſe to fight againſt him, that if at anytime on the one ſide we go about to do good, we are on thother ſide caryed to do euil. What muſt we then doe? We had neede to haue God too array vs with a power and conſtancy, to reſiſte all theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietes and wicked luſtes which are in vs: that wee bee not onely teachable, and gouerned by him, but alſo that wee be fenced with ſuch armour and weapon, as are meeete too
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7694:151"/>fight againſt Satan and all his craftie ſleights and ſtrengths, to the ende our enemie might haue no holde of vs: ſo that wee hauing as Saint Paule ſayth, bothe our headpeece, and ſhielde, might bee armed and appoynted at all peeces, And when as we ſhall be thus armed, then to ſee howe wee ſhould wholly and fully cleaue vnto our God. And whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Deuil ſhall craftily inuent againſt vs, whatſoeuer ſtoppes and lettes are in vs: yet let vs not doubt but too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine victory.</p>
            <p>So then, it is not without cauſe, that Dauid heere ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth theſe twoo thinges togither, to be guided by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of GOD, and abooue all to bee ſo mightily ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, as that no iniquitie could haue dominion ouer him but that he was well able to ouercome all the temptations wherewith Satan any way coulde aſſaile him. Nowe if Dauid, was faine to make ſuch a petition vnto God, with out hypocriſie, by this we may gather of what ſtrength and effect our free will is, which the Papiſtes ſo highly extoll. Whenas we ſhall ſpeake of the ſeruing of God, they ſtraight wayes think that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of our owne power &amp; ſtrength. Not that they doe not confeſſe, but that they had in ſome ſorte neede of God his helpe, but yet that they will bee companions and fellow workers with God, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they for their parte did ſomething of their owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and ſtrength, all of it were nothing. And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, excepte the ſpirit of God leadeth and guideth vs, wee muſte needes ſlippe, yea and vtterly fall away. We ſpeake not heere of an halfe ayde onely: But it is GOD that muſt take the whole conducte and leading into his owne charge. And againe hath he taken vs into his hand? Then no doubt of it, there is a ſeconde grace to be looked for: that is to ſay, that we be ſtrengthened with his holy ſpirite, and ſo to be gouerned, as that wee may haue an inuincible power to perſeuer in wel dooing. Howbeit there is yet one point more to be conſidered of in this verſe: And that is, that Dauid deſiereth to haue all his ſteepes ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too the woorde of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:152"/>
            <p>Nowe by this he ſheweth that if we be gouerned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our owne mindes and fantafies, wee will bee very ſwift to run: But yet not be too ſeeke our ſaluation. And why ſo? becauſe we runne thwart the fieldes, without hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any way and path. Loe heere the maner of the Papiſts, are they able rightly to ſay, that their ſteppes are ordered by the woorde of God? but contrariwiſe, the abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Antichriſt withdraweth them from the right way, to makethem wander and ſtray heere and there, and in the ende to caſt them ſelues headlong into the bottome of hell: in ſuch ſorte, as whatſoeuer they call the ſeruice of God, when as both the endes ſhall be brought togither, we ſhall finde to be ſo many blaſphemyes againſt God. And if they be aſked, Now Sir. I beſeech you, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom haue you your Maſſe, your inuocation of Saintes, prayer for the dead, images, your deifiing of Saintes, your erecting of Aultars vntoo them, your torches, candlelights, pilgrimages, and all the reſt of your beggerly traſh? what aunſwere will they make? They are neuer able to anſwere you one iotte for the maintenance of this their cloutery out of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. What wil they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay? Forſooth, we folow our fathers and their traditions. Yea, but it is heere namely ſet downe, that we muſt be ordered by the woord of God. For all our whole life is a very great diſorder: and we wander &amp; ſtray like vnto brute beaſts, except the word of God be our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule and plaine ſquare. Wherefore let vs bee wel aduiſed not to ſtray as theſe miſerable accurſed people, which cloſe vp their eyes in the cleere day light, yea and which whet them ſelues and ſtubbornly ſtand in opinion againſt God, when he goeth about to reforme them, and to ſhewe them that they haue hitherto vainely ſpente and loſte all their time and trauell. And although that they bee altogither ſo hardened, yet let not vs be ſo: But let vs knowe that there is none other direction that is good, but the very ſame which God ſheweth vnto vs, as was ſayde too Moyſes, Loe this is the way which thou muſt followe. Nowe it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſoone after,</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:7694:152"/>
            <q>O deliuer me from the wrongfull dealings of men: and I will keepe thy commaundements.</q>
            <p>Dauid by this manner of ſpeaking right well declareth, that the Children of God ſhall alwayes bee aſſayled with many and ſundry aſſaultes, perſecutions &amp; griefes, ſo long as they liue heere in this worlde, and the meaning of God is to appoint him to be as it were a Glaſſe for all the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to looke in. For as we ſee how he hath beene intreated, and do alſo ſee his condition and ſtate, no doubt God hath ſet him as it were vpon a ſcaffolde, to the ende we might be conformed according to his example: as he was alſo in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deede, a figure of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now we knowe that our Lorde Ieſus was a true patron of all the Children of god, according vnto whoſe image we muſt be made like, namely in this poynt, to wit, in afflictions, in anguiſhes, and miſeryes, as Saint Paule therof witneſſeth to the Romanes. Since then it is ſo, let vs know that ſo long as we are to liue in this world, we ſhall be alwayes afflicted and troubled by wicked and vngodly men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.</note> neither ought wee too thinke it any ſtrange thing, ſince that Dauid hath ſhewed vs the way: and that God hath purpoſed too haue vs framed after his example, let not the afflictions and perſecutions, which wee muſt abide at this day, ſeeme newe and ſtrange vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Nowe heerevpon it followed, <hi>That he will keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements.</hi> Whereby he ſignified, that he will not forget him ſelfe of ſuch a benefite, when as he ſhall haue God too be his protector, to ſuccour him againſt the malice of men that hee will keepe his commaundementes. Let vs learne then, that when God ſhall haue maintained and defended vs, that we ought to be a great deale the more ready too o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay and feare him: and that this ought alwaies too ſtirre vs vp to a greater conſideration: that as hee dayly increaceth more and more his benefites vppon vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ought our affee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo to ſerue him, increaſe and beſides it muſte more profite and inflame itſelfe. Nowe it followeth by and by after,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:153"/>
            <q>Shewe the light of thy countenaunce vpon thy ſeruaunt: and teach me thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>By this he confirmeth the matter which he before han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled: and therefore we ſhall not neede to ſtande much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this verſe: for he ſheweth that he is contented too haue God to looke and care for him, And to proue this too bee true, you may ſee, that the thing which hee deſireth, is that which I haue already touched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, the principall ſafetie which the Children of God ought to haue, is, to ſtay them ſelues vpon this prouidence of God, when as they certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowe and may boldely ſay, that God ſtandeth for vs, and will neuer forget vs: and although wee be neuer ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creatures, yet for all that he careth for vs, watcheth ouer vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and alſo hee hath an eye vntoo vs, neither will he ſuffer any hurt to come vnto vs, but will prouide for all our needes and wantes. And if we carry this minde with vs, we haue the greateſt benefite that is poſſibly to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this is it which Dauid ſpeaketh of in this place, when he ſayeth, <hi>Shewe the light of thy countenaunce, O Lorde, vpon thy ſeruant.</hi> For he meaneth that when he ſhall feele the protection of God, he is then ſure that God looketh vnto him, and that the ſame is it, which ſhall deliuer him from all cares. Nowe let vs note that this manner of ſpeech is drawne from a ſimilitude, as when wee thinke God his countenaunce to be darkened in the time of our trouble &amp; aduerſitie: and feeling no comfort whereby too glad our ſelues in him, it ſeemeth to vs by &amp; by, that there are great and monſtrous thick cloudes betwixt him and vs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently we imagine that God ſeeth vs not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dauid ſo farre as fleſh and blood coulde reach vnto, ſaith, Shewe the light of thy countenaunce, that is, make me to feele that thou haſt care ouer me. And in the ende he ſayth, <hi>Mine eyes guſh out with riuers of water: becauſe men keepe not thy law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he declareth that ouer and beſids the deſier which we ought to haue, and wherwith we ought to be affected to cleaue vnto God according to his word, what a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7694:153"/>&amp; grief it ſhould be vnto vs, to ſee the ſcorners which ſo contemne and deſpiſe the word of God, too treade the ſame vnder foote, &amp; beſids, to ſee the wicked to ouerthrow all good order and iuſtice. See then, that the true childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God ought not onely to be contented with their own wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aright, &amp; to be framed according to the law of God: But they ought alſo by al meanes poſſible to labor to bring the whole world to that paſſe with them, too the ende that all the creatures of God might with one accord reuerence and glorifie his maieſtie. And therefore when as they ſee God to be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, they ſhould begreeued thereat, &amp; not only to be ſory &amp; vexed: but alſo to bee as it were mortally wounded. For it is not without cauſe that Dauid ſaith here <hi>That riuers of water guſhed out of his eyes:</hi> He meaneth hereby, that he was ſo ſorrowful &amp; vexed as could not be expreſſed, Now if Dauid had occaſion to grone and weepe after this ſort, when he ſee God to be reiected, what ſhall become of this our time I pray you? to what an extremitie are we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e? Is not impietie or vngodlines growne at this day to a full meaſure? Doe we not ſee the vngodly exceede in al abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wickednes? one ſorte is fallen out with God and the goſpel: Another ſort will confeſſe with the mouth that they allowe of it or deſire it: and yet we ſee them to be an hundreth thouſand times worſe then the papiſts: no dout of it we ſhall find amongſt vs of that ſort, ſuch deuils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſo vilanous and deteſtable, as that the very aire cryeth out vnto god for vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt them. When then we ſhall ſee theſe accurſed monſters to make no account of God nor godlines, muſt we not needs be greeued as Dauid was? Let vs know that God wil bleſſe our crying and gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when we ſhall haue this godly ſorrowe: as too ſee his law thus deſtroyed and ouerthrown, &amp; not to bee regarded with that reuerence that it deſerueth. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the contemners of God muſt one day come to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when as they ſhalbe mery after another ſorte, &amp; then they ſhalbe aſſured to make a reckoning for the grones and lamentations of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God: when they do not only vexe the mortall creatures of God, but euen the liuing
<pb facs="tcp:7694:154"/>God him ſelf, and his holy ſpirit which dwelleth in vs, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome all ſuch ſighes and grones doe proceede. And ſo, when as we lament, to ſee the law of God to be ſo deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the wicked, let vs put them ouer too the iudgement of God, before whome they ſhall make an accounte of all the grones and ſighes whiche wee ſhall haue powred out, which they thought by their gibinges and laughinges too ſtrangle and choke. For although they treade vnder foote the lawe of God ſo much as in them lyeth, yet the ſorrowe and griefe which we abide for it, ſhall aſcend into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens to cry for vengeaunce of them.</p>
            <p>According to this holſome Doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our offences, beſeeching him that it woulde pleaſe him to make vs better to feele our miſeryes then we haue heretofore felt them, yea to the end we may lay them open vnto him, and to ſeeke for remedy where it is too bee founde: that is, that after this our good God hath inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened vs in his knowledge, that it would pleaſe him more and more, to increaſe the brightneſſe thereof in vs, and ſo to confirme vs, as that wee neuer chaunge from the right way. And although we are too withſtand a great number of aſſaultes, and that the Deuill neuer ceaſeth craftely too goe about infinite wayes too trouble vs: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding let vs beſeech him too giue vs an inuincible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to reſiſt them, vntill ſuch time as we bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fully Conquerors, and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vnto him ſelfe, too liue in his kingdome in euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioy and felicitie.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is certaine that there is no man but will eaſily graunte, the lawe of God to be bothe good and holy, and that wee ought not onely to allowe of it: but alſo to receiue it with all feare and reuerence. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, there are very few touched with this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to vnderſtand that there is ſuch a perfection in the word of God, as that nothing can bee founde therein, but all puritie and ſinceritie: and too
<pb facs="tcp:7694:155"/>be ſo infallible a trueth, &amp; a righteouſneſſe ſo certaine as poſſible can not be more certaine and ſure. But very fewe there are which vnderſtand this, or at the leaſte which are very greatly touched heerewith. And therefore it is not without cauſe, that Dauid in this preſent pſalme, vſeth ſuch a repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he ſo highly magnifieth the doctrine which hee hath learned out of the lawe of God: to the ende too declare vntoo vs, that wee haue greatly profited, when wee ſhall haue ſuch a ſauour and iudgement throughly imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our heartes. When as, I ſay, this righteouſneſſe, this wiſedome, and this ſinceritie which is contayned in the woorde of God, ſhall be very well and throughly knowen vnto vs: then may we be able to ſay with Dauid, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and true in thy iudgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the holy ſpirite of God ſpeaking by the mouth Dauid, hath ſet down here no ſuperfluous matter, but ſuch as he knewe to be profitable for our inſtruction: Let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dillgently weigh and conſider all the wordes, which are heere touched. In the firſt place he ſayth, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord: and true in thy Iudgements.</hi> We haue already here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore handled, that the iudgements of God in this Pſalme are called, the commandements of the law which he giueth vnto vs, to rule our liues by. Euen ſo, when Dauid ſaith, that God is righteous &amp; true in his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: It is aſmuch as if he had ſaid, That god hath declared what his nature is in his law, that we might behold him in it, as in a glaſſe. This then is aſmuch as if he ſhould haue ſaid, O Lord, wee haue thine Image truely and liuely pictured and expreſſed in this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which thou haſt deliuered vnto vs in thy law, there we ſee thee to be righteous, and alſo that thou haſt commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing therein, which tendeth not to the ſame ende. Wil we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> magnifie God aright? We muſt know him to be ſuch a one as he ſheweth himſelfe to be by his word, &amp; not to faſhion our ſelues like vnto a great number of ſcoffers, which wil not ſtick to ſay that god is altogither good, wiſe, and righteous: but yet they wil ſeparate them ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his word: forge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues a God in the aire, or elſe they would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7694:155"/>bee contented that there were ſuch a medley as that there were no more diuinitie known. Now ſee how god ſheweth himſelf, as I haue ſaid, by his word. We muſt then, if wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe him to be righteous, good, true, &amp; faithfull, to giue theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendarions vnto his word, wherin he hath once for all declared vnto vs his wil. Now after Dauid hath vſed this word righteous, he addeth, <hi>Thou haſt commanded iuſtice by thy teſtimomes, and trueth eſpecially.</hi> See the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid handleth it him ſelfe, ſhewing that the lawe of God is wholy righteous, becauſe ſaith he, that it leadeth vs to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and trueth. Now when theſe two thinges are in it, what may we ſay, but that which hath already beene before ſaid? What is that? It is ſo far of with a greate number, that when they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced heerof, are perſwaded in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to ſay Amen without deſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling. And to proue it to be ſo, how many men ſhal we ſee ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in this point to the trueth of God, whereunto he deſireth to leade vs by his word? How many I ſay, ſhal we find, which wil yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues teachable vnto it? But contrariwiſe, we ſhall finde the greateſt part cleane contrary. It is very true we ſhalbe aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yea euen horribly affraid, to ſay, that there is any thing in the law of God, which is not true &amp; iuſt: &amp; yet for al that it may as eaſily be perceued, that there is no ſuch knowledg ingrauen in our harts, as to be aſſured therof. To be ſhort, this is fardeſt of from our mindes, when we ſhal ſay thus: I ſpeake now of thoſe which are not yet throughly inſtructed by the ſpirit of God. Neither yet let vs think this too be a common &amp; ordinary thing, when as Dauid ſaith, That the teſtimonies of God are nothing but true &amp; righteous. For although we haue learned ſomwhat out of them, yet is not this inough, vntil ſuch time as we are conformed &amp; framed vnto them, that we fully &amp; wholy agree with this ſaying &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation which is heere giuen to the law of God. Now becauſe Dauid would ſhew with what affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is moued, he proteſteth, that he was not only greued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he felt in himſelf any rebellion againſt God, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceiued it
<pb facs="tcp:7694:156"/>in others, that he conceiued a wonderful ſorrow and griefe, yea euen a memelous torment of minde. For hee ſayeth, That his zeale had euen conſumed him, that he was as one deade, and ſo throwne downe as hee coulde not be more. Now, he namely ſpeaketh of his enemies, and of ſuch as had affiled him : But hee ſignifieth anon after, that all the miſchiefes and iniuryes which they had done vnto him, did not halfe ſo mightily greeue him, as the contempte which he kriewe to be in them touching the lawe of God. For hee ſayth,</p>
            <q>My zeale hath euen conſumed me: becauſe mine enemyes haue forgotten thy woordes.</q>
            <p>Heere then Dauid ſheweth in effect, that hee was not ſo greatly greeued nor yet ſo ſorrowfull for all the euils and wrongs which he indured at the handes of men, as too ſee the woord of God to be caſt vnder feete and clcerely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. See heere, I ſay, a moſte ſure teſtimony that he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preferred the word of God, before his owne perſon:that he had not that pleaſure in his life, nor in whatſoeuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the ſame, as he had in the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which al the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures of God ought to haue towards his maieſtie, Nowe if he had not had this zeale, he could neuer haue bene thus grieued and vexed, when as men made no reckoning of the word of God, and caſt it behinde their backs. And heere we are throughty too conſider, that Dauid ſpake not in this place of a meane ſorrowe. For then this had beene inough. to haue ſaid, Alas my God, I haue beene a great deale mote greeued to ſee the wicked co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne thy word, then when as they perſecuted my ſelf although that I wis ſore troubled &amp; greuouſly oppreſſed, yet had I greater regard to thy law, then to alwhatſoeuer concerned mine owne perſon. This had bin inough, ſay I, if Dauid had ſaid but thus much: but he went a great deale farther, ſaying, <hi>The zeale of the houſe of God, hath euen gnawne and eaten me vp.</hi> Heere he ſaith that he was conſumed &amp; brought to nothing, fo that he had no ſtrength in himſelf. Now here we muſt note by the way, that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7694:156"/>Dauid ſpake not this to bragge of him ſelf: but rather hath ſet foorth this his example for our better inſtruction, to the ende we might learne to haue the honour of God and the reuerence of his woorde in ſuch recommendation, as that when we ſee the worlde to make light of it, and too forget it, we ſhould be grieued and tormented a great deale more, then if we did abide all the griefes, extreeme wronges and iniuries that were poſsible: yea, that all our particular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, or domage, and whatſoeuer is moſt deare, ought to be nothing vnto vs in reſpect of this light reckoning of the word of God. Loe here what holſome leſſons and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we haue to gather out of this place.</p>
            <p>Nowe when he ſaith, that it grieued him to ſee the word of God cleane forgotten, what then ſhall become of the matter, when as men ſhall not onely forget it, but euen with a moſt deteſtable furie oppoſe them ſelues wholy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? As at this day, we ſhal not onely ſay that the word of God is forgotten: but men of a ſet purpoſe runne vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently vpon it vtterly to aboliſhe it. And to proue it to bee ſo, I beſeeche you, whence commeth this crueltie and furie of the Papiſtes: but bicauſe that they are purpoſed clerely to goe againſt it? to be angry with God, not abiding too ſuffer them ſelues to be ſubiect vnto him by any maner of meanes? They will not ſay thus in plaine woordes, but wee may iudge of the matter ſo farre foorth as wee ſee it. For, howe ſhould it be poſsible, that they ſhould ſo rage againſt the knowne and certaine truth, if they were not euen the very profeſſed enemies of God? and without they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſtand againſt him eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the hard hedge, as we ſay? I will not denie but that men many times ſhall forget the word of God, when as they ſhalbe carried away with their wicked affections. As thus, when a man is greatly giuen to lecherie, this villainous deſire ſo blindeth him, as that hee clerely forgetteth whatſoeuer he hath heard ſpoken againſt it neuer ſo little before: to wit, they which defile their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with lechery, do deface, as much as in them lieth the image of God, pollute his temple, deuide and pull in pieces
<pb facs="tcp:7694:157"/>the body of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhut them ſelues quite out of the kingdome of heauen, and prouoke the heauy wrath and curſe of God againſt them. And yet an whoremaiſter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth all theſe notable ſayings, which are ſet downe too keepe him within his reyne. The couetous man alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth what equitie and right is, let him be admoniſhed thereof neuer ſo often, as to bee pitifull to his neighbours, to helpe the poore and needy, rather then to take away an other mans goods and ſubſtance, and to be ſo giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our own gaine: to procure and profit the welfare of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, rather then to be giuen too ſeeke our owne priuate commoditie. A couetous man I ſay, will quite forget all this. And why ſo? Forſooth, bicauſe he is blinded with this couetous deſire of gayne, and too heape vp together the goods of this world. See then when it is, that the worde of God ſhall be forgotten, verely euen then when as men ſhall be drunken with their inordinate greedy paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But they which ſet them ſelues againſt God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea with a fury &amp; frenſy vtterly to abrogate his worde, too turne his truth into lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſay, do not onely forget the word of God, but remember them ſelues of it too too much, euen to ſett them ſelues purpoſely againſt it. And we need to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but euen into the ſtate of Popery, to ſee ſuch a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and deteſtable impietie. For we ſhal ſee theſe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of God, which are euen here amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs, yea and which come ſometimes to defile the temple of God, to thruſt in their ſwyniſh groynes: and to ſcorne the doctrine which ſhalbe read, which maketh euen the very deuils in hell too tremble. Wee ſhal ſee then here theſe contemners of God, which will euen lift them velues vp againſt him, and powre out their blaſphemies, &amp; is it meete that we diſſemble this? No, not ſo, but let vs rather ſtirre vp our ſelues to groaning yea to crie out with a loude voyce, beſeeching GOD too ſtretch forth his mighty and ſtrong arme, againſt ſuch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, &amp; fier bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of hell, ſuch vpholders of Satan, which thus come too defile the ſacred and holy things of God, which his maieſtie hath ſet before vs for our ſaluation. And
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7694:157"/>thus much for this point. And againe let vs not onely bee grieued and ſorrowefull, bicauſe there are in vs rebellious affections which ſo hinder vs, as that wee cannot take any ſuch taſte as is to be wiſhed for in the worde of God: but alſo when as we ſee that men ſo lightly eſteeme and forget this word of God, that they outrage in all wickednes, it can not be but that we muſt be grieued and ſorrowefull for the ſame. And yet there is a further matter to bee required at our handes, which is this, that when wee ſhall ſee and heare the name of God to be blaſphemed, and his maieſtie viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we ſhould be tormented, and feele a greater griefe for the ſame, then for all the euill that might come vnto our ſelues: for it is very good reaſon that the maieſtie of God ſhould be more deare vnto vs without all compariſon, then our owne perſons and liues. Nowe ſince it is ſo, that if wee ought to be ſorrowefull, when as we ſee the worde of God to be forgotten by others, euen to beginne at the beſt end, if the euill be founde in vs (as Satan moueth vs to fall vnto wickedneſſe, and we are very farre of from truly ſeruing of God, and looking to his word, with ſuch feare and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as in deede we ought:) ſince then, I ſay, we are ſo greatly to be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that we haue ſo many ſinnes fighting againſt the lawe of God: euen ſo much the more ought we to ſigh and groane: as ſaint Paul right well ſheweth vs, ſaying, Oh accurſed man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me out this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body. Loe here ſaint Paul, in ſhewing their condition &amp; ſtate to be miſerable which liue in this world, exhorteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to groaning, and to a continuall ſorrowe and care, bicauſe they are not able fully and throughly to yelde them ſelues to the word of God: ſo that whenſoeuer wee ſhall doe but euen ſo much, we ſhall render a true proufe and teſtimonie of our faith &amp; Chriſtianitie. Now it followeth ſoone after,</p>
            <q>Thy word is proued moſt pure: and thy ſeruant loueth it.</q>
            <p>Here it verily ſeemeth (as we haue before ſaide) that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid bringeth in a moſt manifeſt ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yea, knowne euen vnto the ſimpleſt: to wit, that the word of God is pure and cleane, without ſpot and blemiſhe. But what? let vs ſee a little whether wee putte this puritie in practize or
<pb facs="tcp:7694:158"/>not, alas, wee are farre from it. For euen then wee may ſaye the worde of God too bee pure and without ſpot, when as without any gayneſaying we only truſt in him, and that we haue a true certaintie of our ſaluation, bicauſe he hath once ſtretched foorth his hand vnto vs, and promiſed neuer too faile vs. When then we ſhall haue ſuch a confidence in God that wee may boldly walke through death, and the very gulfe of hell: that in ſeeing the bottomles pittes open too ſwallowe vs vp, we ſhould not doubt of our ſaufetie, ſince that we are in the hand of God: loe howe the word of God ſhalbe pure vnto vs. But nowe are wee all in a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vayne. And from whence commeth this? It is bicauſe we are full of infinite filthineſſe and pollutions: to be ſhort, there is nothing but ſtenche in vs, and all our ſenſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed. Let vs firſt beginne at our eyes, and we ſhall haue ſuch a number of filthy troubleſome and glimſing gloatings: to wit, ſuch a number of vanities which hinder vs too knowe the puritie that is in the worde of God, as loe wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loſt one of our ſenſes. Afterwarde, we are depriued of our hearing, bicauſe our eares are ſo filled with ſuch trifling yea and peruerſe matters, that wee can giue no eare vnto God, or els, that which entreth in at one eare, goeth out at another, as we ſay. Now if this be already a great vice in vs, to be ſo ſlacke as to receiue but one good leſſon, the ſecond is no whit leſſe, that when we ſhall haue gotten euen a very little, it ſhall incontinent ſo melt away from vs, as that wee ſhall neuer thinke more of it. We ſee howe iolly and friſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our feete and handes are, when as wee heare any talke of ribauldrie and filthineſſe, and altogether dull and ſenſles when any ſpeach is of vertue and godlineſſe. There is neuer a finger in our handes, but will bee as good as a rayſour, to cut euen to the quicke, if any talke ſhalbe had to offend the maieſtie of God. And in the meane while we ſhall not finde one man that will once lift him ſelfe vp too doe any good. See howe all our ſenſes are corrupt, and howe full of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and filthineſſe. And this is it which hindreth vs, that we are not able to knowe howe the worde of God is to be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7694:158"/>tried. Now it followeth,</p>
            <q>I am ſmall and of no reputation: yet do I not forget thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes.</q>
            <p>This ſaying here importeth more then at the firſt ſight it ſeemeth to doe: It is very true, that it ſhould ſeeme a farre harder matter for the mightie men of this worlde to ſerue God then the meaner ſort: in ſo much as wee will neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it ſtraunge if a man of baſe condition hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the word of God. But what is the cauſe why wee ſo greatly prattle, iangle, and lift vp our ſelues ſo arrogantly againſt him, and that we ſubmitte not our ſelues wholy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? Forſooth euen the very honours and delightes of this worlde are oftentimes the chiefeſt cauſes. When a man ſhalbe in any credit, eſtimation, and reputation hee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto him ſelfe an idoll in his owne heart: and herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forgetteth God, and thinketh him ſelfe to bee no longer vnder his gouernement. When then our Lorde God hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs in a lowe eſtate, hee putteth vs in minde, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vs by this meanes not to forget his commandements, and to walke in his feare with all humilitie. But Dauid his meaning tendeth to another ende, that is, although he was as it were contemned, yet ceaſed he not to loue God. Nowe as I haue ſaid, this is not here ſet downe without cauſe. It is very true, that when God liberally beſtoweth vpon vs great ſtore of benefites, then are we ſo blockiſh, as that we thinke our ſelues leaſt beholden vnto him. And contrariwiſe, they vpon whome hee hath not beſtowed ſuch graces, thinke them ſelues for their partes, not ſo greatly bounden vnto him. And in very deede, the worlde will alwayes finde ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting holes, to keepe it ſelfe out from the ſeruice and feare of God, or els will be ſo lightly diſcharged thereof, as that it may be done without any great paine. As howe I praye you? We ſee, that they which pretend colour of ignorance, which haue neither knowledge either of God or of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will ſay, ſurely for my part I am but a poore ſimple man, and without learning, and therefore I will leaue this geare to thoſe that are learned. One ſort will excuſe them
<pb facs="tcp:7694:159"/>ſelues one way, another, another way: but yet they all tende to this ende, to exempt them ſelues from the obedience of God, &amp; not to be ſubiect either to him or yet to his word. See here the common ſaying amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Papiſtes. Ha ſirra: This is the office of the prieſtes &amp; the cloyſterers: our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates haue the charge ouer vs: wee are ſecular and lay men, we muſt haue nothing to do with this geare. And beſides, euen the meaneſt ſort of vs, haue alſo our excuſes, and will ſay, I am a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I muſt get my liuing with great paines all the day long by my handy worke, I haue ſcarſly any ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure once co come to heare a ſermon on the Sunday. See what ſtarting holes we finde out, to the ende we might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe our vanities, pleaſures, and idle times, or I knowe not what other our ſlouthfulnes, rather then wee woulde heare the word of God and meditate thereon. So then, Dauid contrarily ſheweth, that whiles he was ſmall and of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: yet that he neuer ceaſed continually to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this leſſon, euen to ſubmit him ſelfe to the obedience of God. And ſo we ſee him to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his childhood: and that he did not onely take pleaſure therein, when God had aduaunced him to the kingdome, that hee did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin then to taſte of the lawe of God &amp; to apply his whole ſtudy thereto: but when hee kept his fathers ſheepe and cattle, and was brought vp in the ſheepecoates, before hee came any thing neare the court: euen all that while, I ſay, he neuer ceaſed but was wholy occupied in the holy ſtudy of the lawe of God. Nowe let vs learne hereby not to exempt out ſelues by our trifling excuſes, as a great number of men do: but let vs vnderſtand, that Dauid here exhorteth all the faithfull in general: that the contemptible, baſe, and ſimple peſons, yea euen as ſimple as yong children and that haue no knowledge of that which is moſt eſteemed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ought not for all that to forget the word of God. And ſo, let alſo both great and ſmal giue them ſelues to the ſtudy thereof, that we may be all the ſchollers of the lawe, and of the Prophets, but eſpecially of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt ſeeing that God hath now beſtowed a more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7694:159"/>grace vppon vs, then euer hee beſtowed vppon Dauid. For ouer and beſides the doctrine which Dauid receiued from the mouth of Moyſes, ſee how God hath layd open vnto vs the infinite treaſure of his heauenly wiſedome, inſomuch as we haue the Goſpel, out of which the ſonne of God hath ſpoken vnto vs, who is maiſter ouer the whole houſhold, as it is ſaid in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes. Now is this the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that muſt make heauen and earth to tremble,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6.</note> as it is ſpoken by the Prophet Haggay: &amp; as this place is alledged by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7.</note> to ſhew vnto vs that we ought to receiue the Goſpel with greater reuerence, then the fathers did the law &amp; the Prophets. For God made the earth to ſhake when he gaue the law by Moyſes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25.26.27.</note> which ſince that time hath bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed &amp; ratified by the Prophets: but when as hee opened his holy mouth by his ſonne to teach vs: that was to make both heauen and earth to ſhake, bicauſe he hath layd open ſuch a wonderfull wiſedome, as that it ought to ſhake &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh vs, when as God ſpeaketh with ſuch power &amp; maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie vnto vs. See then as concerning this ſaying, where Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſaith, that he did not forget the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, although he was ſmal &amp; of no reputation. Now he addeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy righteouſnes is an euerlaſting righteouſnes: and thy lawe is the truth.</hi> Yea in ſuch ſort, that when he was afflicted &amp; grieued, that he tooke pleaſure in ſaying, thy righteouſnes is an euerlaſting righteouſneſſe, heere Dauid repeateth a word which hath a double ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in the firſt place Righteouſnes, ſignifieth the law of God, &amp; that bicauſe it is the rule of all goodnes. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> next, he giueth it the title of righteouſneſſe, ſignifying thereby, that this law is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a rule, as that when we ſhal haue throughly ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it euen to the bottome, we ſhal finde that God hath ſet down therein a perfection of all equitie and ſinceritie: as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, this is without all doubt a perfect rule of righteouſnes. Now he coupleth as hee hath already before done, truth, with righteouſneſſe. I haue already ſaide, that theſe wordes here, are oftentimes repeated: and yet it is no ſuperfluous kinde of ſpeache.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:160"/>
            <p>And what is the reaſon? Becauſe we might fully and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe that God hath ſpoken moſte wiſely, that all mennes mouthes might be ſtopped, and that we al at once might be ſilent and ſtil to heare him. There is no man but will confeſſe this at the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues end: But in the meane time for vs to knowe this equitie and trueth, which is contayned in the word of God, Alas we are too too farre off.</p>
            <p>So then, let euery man looke well vnto him ſelfe, and ſee whether his life be agreeable vnto the word of God or no. And if it be, it is a manifeſt proofe that the righteouſneſſe and trueth thereof is deepely imprinted in his heart. Nowe if this be ſo, then no doubt of it God his woord is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it is worthy. Then let vs render vnto him effectually, the prayſes which are heere attributed vnto him, and as they doe appertaine vnto his maieſtie. But if wee doe ſay that the word of God is good and holy, that it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful righteouſneſſe and power that cannot fail, and yet deſpiſe it in deede, ſhewe our ſelues cleane contrary vnto it in our life and conuerſation, and making a goodly ſhewe to honor it, doe ſpit at it: What a kinde of honor call yee this? Wherfore we are to conſider, that it is mete that this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and trueth of the lawe of God be imprinted in our heartes, that we may make ſuch a confeſſion thereof, as Dauid heere hath doone. And ſee why heere hee addeth, <hi>Yet is my delight in thy Commaundements,</hi> Yea when hee was afflicted, and in aduerſitie. For it is an eaſy matter for men to praiſe God whiles they are quiet and out of trouble, &amp; haue all their heartes deſire. Yea wee ſhall ſee the very hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites cry out with open mouthe, O bleſſed bee God, and our good God: Forſooth when as hee ſendeth them euen their wiſhe, and intreateth them according too their owne deſires. But when God ſhall afflict vs, ſo that wee be grieuouſly vexed, vntill we can no more: Loe heere a good tryall to make vs feele, that we haue willingly and in earneſt honored him in his word. And we ſhall ſhew it too bee ſo, when as we ſhall not chaunge our mindes: but conſtantly perſeuer in it, and ſay, whether ſhall I now runne? ſee how
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7694:160"/>I am afflicted: well, it is my God that muſt reſtore me. It is very true that I am not without great ſtoare of ſorrowes and griefes which trouble mee: But yet I will content my ſelfe with this, that God loueth me. It is true that as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the worlde I am tormented: but I will comfort my ſelfe that my God hath called me vnto him, that he ſheweth vnto me in deede that he will haue compaſsion vpon mee, that he taketh me for one of his children, and will extende his fatherly goodnes towardes mee. See here a very good proufe and triall, that we take the woorde of God to bee true and righteous: that is, that if wee bee grieued with trouble and aduerſitie, yet that we do neuer forget him, nor it. But what? let vs once come to the practize thereof, and then we ſhall ſee howe it fareth with vs. For it is a matter of nothing too lende our eares, and ſaye, ſurely this is a very good ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that there was, nothing taught in it but very good and holſome doctrine, and truely if wee haue once ſayde but euen thus much, wee will by and by thinke, that God is greatly in our debte. A man that commeth thus euen with the eares of an Aſſe to playe the hypocrite, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth verly that God is bounde vnto him, bicauſe hee hath done him thus much honour.</p>
            <p>Now this is an ouergroſſe and impudent kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, in this maner to thinke to pleaſe the maieſtie of God. But yet the caſe ſo ſtandeth, as that the greater part is euen ſo giuen: nowe what is the next way for vs too bee ridde of all togither? Forſooth euen this, That when wee for a time ſhall make a ſhowe to giue diligent eare vnto the worde of God, that all whatſoeuer we haue heard, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent melt and vaniſh cleane away from vs. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee very well ſhewe, that the truth and righteouſneſſe which is in his word, is not ſo imprinted in vs as it ought to be Now Dauid addeth in the ende, <hi>Yet my delight is in thy commandements.</hi> Whereby he aduertiſeth vs, that it is not enough that we cal to minde that we haue vnderſtoode the word of ſaluation, too the ende to profite our ſelues in the time of affliction: but it muſt be of this ſtrength and power
<pb facs="tcp:7694:161"/>euen to gladde vs in the middeſt of our ſorrowes. It is very true, that we ſhall not be ſenſeles and without feeling. And Dauid alſo hath very well experimented, how greatly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and anguiſh tormented him. He felt then both harde and bitter paſsions: and yet this hindered him little, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and to be glad. And although he was greatly vexed as touching the fleſh, yet felt he ſuch ſpiritual ioy in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of God, that ſorrow ouercame him not. Now, if Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid as before wee haue declared, tooke ſuch pleaſure in the law, wheras God only ſhewed himſelf to the ancient fathers, as it were in ſhadowes I beſeeche you, how ought the word of God at this day to glad vs? Where as he ſheweth him ſelf ſo familiar a father towards vs, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opening vnto vs the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry botome of his heart, hiding nothing from vs? When the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord God poureth out the treaſures of his infinite loue and goodnes vpon vs ſo aboundantly: haue not wee a farre greater occaſion to reioyce, then the fathers who liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe? Yes verely: but our vnthankefulneſſe ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth vs, as that in knowing, we know nothing, and in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſee no whit at al. And yet is not this written without cauſe. Euen ſo, when as we ſhall feele the griefes, anguiſhes, and afflictions of this worlde to trouble vs, let vs haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto this word of God: for in it we ſhal finde him to ſtretch forth his hand to drawe vs vnto him, declaring that he will helpe the afflicted, haue pitie of the miſerable and vexed, ayde the wretched, deſireth nothing els but to bring back againe poore ſinners which wil yeld them ſelues vnto him, lay all their cares in his lappe, and that hee will vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vs of them all. When then wee are ſure, and reſolute of ſuch God his goodneſſe towardes vs, by his promiſes, wee ought to come vnto him, to call vpon him, and to reioyce in him: ſo that we may ſay with Dauid, O Lord, my delight hath byn in thy teſtimonies, that they might glad me in the middeſt of my afflictions. Loe how the children of God, win all the time of their affliction may continually doe, reioyce in the aſſurance of their ſaluation, yea when as they ſhal ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them ſelues vpon his promiſes, and receiue them in ſuch
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7694:161"/>ſort as that they may turne to their benefit. Now for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion Dauid ſaith, <hi>The righteouſnes of thy teſtimonies is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting:</hi> and afterward he maketh his prayer &amp; ſaith, <hi>graunt me vnderſtanding and I ſhall liue.</hi> See yet againe this worde, righteouſnes which is here repeated, and that to very good purpoſe: For this is according to that which I haue already ſaid, that they which dare not openly rayle &amp; iangle againſt God to blaſpheme his word, yet will they be for all that ful of malice, and treaſon: or els they wilbe ſo nuſſeled in their vanities as that the righteouſnes of God ſhall not appeare in them. So then, Dauid yet ſetteth it down, to bee an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſſe: ſignifying that we ought not to take them as puftes of wynde, as a great number of men haue done, to magnifie God, and after in the turning of an hand to go cleane backward. As at this daye wee ſhall haue them which will make a ſhew of great deuotion, and ſay, O what an excellent ſermon, O what notable doctrine was taught this day? But I beſeeche you what wil they ſay the next day? Forſooth they will not for all this ſticke too mocke God, make one ieſt or other at his word: or els, if God ſend them any aduerſitie, they wilbe grieued and angry with him: ſo that if they be put in minde of that which they before had heard, they will anſwere, that they haue cleane forgotten it. Dauid therefore meaning to ſhew, that wee muſt not bee ſo ſlacke as at ſometimes to commende the worde of God, ſayeth, that it is an euerlaſting righteouſnes. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, it is very true that men are chaungeable, and this preſent life alſo is ſubiect to very many chaunges, as to daye we ſhall haue ſome griefe or other, and to morrowe be well againe: oftentimes many troubles ſhall come vnto vs: and wee ſhall ſee them at laſt too haue an ende: and yet for all theſe continuall chaunges, men muſt not in the meane while be carried away with euery blaſt of wynde, to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and vnſtedfaſt: but whiles they are ſayling through the waues of the ſea, they muſt holde them ſelues firme and ſure in this righteouſneſſe and ſinceritie which is in the woorde of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:162"/>
            <p>See then howe me muſt know the euerlaſting ſtablenes of the righteouſneſſe of the lawe. And in deede wee ſhall haue thereof a full feeling and declaration in the worde of God, when as wee ſhall receiue it as wee ought: but for ſo much as wee faile herein, and that wee haue not as of our ſelues the ſpirite to comprehend this righteouſneſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in this place mention is made, ne yet to attaine thereto: yea, and if that we ſhould attaine therto, ſo that there were nothing to leade vs to iniquitie, yet let vs pray with Dauid, that it would pleaſe God to giue vs vnderſtanding. Now it is moſt true that Dauid had already receiued ſome portion and meaſure of vnderſtanding: for els he could neuer haue ſaide, I haue beene grieued and troubled, and yet my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was in thy lawe. Hee coulde not poſsibly bee carried with ſuch an affection, but that the word of God had tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the very bottome of his heart: but when he beſought God to giue him vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, he mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to haue God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that grace which before he had receiued. Nowe if he who was ſo greatly aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced: yea that had receiued the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of prophecie to inſtruct others, which is the principall ſpirite to gouerne the people of God: If hee, I ſaye, had neede to make ſuch a prayer, what ſhall wee do, which haue ſcarſely any one ſparke of vnderſtanding in our myndes? ought not we, I beſeeche you, to praye with a more feruent deſire, to haue God to grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs vnderſtanding? And a great deale the more ought wee to bee ſtirred vp thereto, when as Dauid ſayeth, that wee are not able too lyue, vntill ſuch time as GOD hath ſo enlightened vs: too the ende wee might conceiue this truthe and righteouſneſſe which is in his lawe. See here, I ſaye, howe that the life of men cannot be but accurſed, vntill ſuch time as they are come euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this point. And ſo, let vs not learne too pleaſe our ſelues, as theſe miſerable wretched worldlinges doe, who are euen drunken in their pleaſures and paſtimes, and thinke that there is no pleaſure nor felicitie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they exceede and outrage in all vanities and follies: But lette vs looke a great deale higher, lette vs ſeeke
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7694:162"/>after God, &amp; know that then our life ſhalbe bleſſed, when as God ſhall haue deliuered vs from theſe vayne allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this wicked worlde, to make vs feele truth and righteouſnes which is in his word: that it may be the onely ende of our life, of all our councelles, and our onely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſtudy: To be ſhort, the very ſummarie of all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we take in hande.</p>
            <p>According too this holy doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our offences, beſeeching him that it woulde pleaſe him to make vs to feele them better then heretofore wee haue: that we knowing our owne wretchedneſſe and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; what neede we haue of his aſsiſtance, might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto him, hauing our whole refuge to his goodnes and mercy, and ſtay our ſelues vpon his promiſes, not dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but that as he is true and faithfull in all that he ſayeth, ſo alſo that he will fulfill whatſoeuer hee hath ſhewed vnto vs in his worde: to wit, that he wil ſo vnite vs vnto him ſelf, as that after he hath ſeparated vs from all the filthineſſe of this world, he will make vs partakers of his righteouſneſſe, and finally of his glorie. That he will not onely graunt vs, this grace, but alſo all people and nations of the earth. &amp;c.</p>

Euen as in this place Dauid his meaning is to ſet before our eyes, not that he meant to glorifie him ſelfe of his owne ſtrength, thereby to get him eſtimation, but to the ende that this example might direct vs the right waye. We ſee then howe carefull Dauid was to call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of God, how he applied his whole affection, and continued therein, bicauſe that euery of vs might doe the like. Nowe in the firſt place he ſayeth,</p>
            <q>I haue cried out with my whole heart.</q>
            <p>Wherety he ſignifieth vnto vs, that he babbled not eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the hypocrites doe, or els that he cried not out vppon
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7694:163"/>God for a faſhion or coldely, but prayed with a true &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt zeale. Neither do we any otherwiſe but euen prophane the name of God, when as wee pray vnto him without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue mindes hauing our thoughts wandring this waye and that waye, and on euery ſide. Let vs then conſider, what it is principally to be required in our prayers, which is, that we muſt not only wagge the tongue, and open our mouth, with an intent to pray vnto God: but we muſt pray ſincerely and purely alſo vnto him from the bottom of our harts. Now in very deed we ought to bring this into a more plaine order: But yet according to the manner which wee haue heretofore kept in handling of this Pſalme, it ſhal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that we ſet down euery thing briefly in certain articles. It remaineth then for this tyme that euery one priuately by himſelf doth more diligently meditate &amp; beſtow his whole ſtudie herein. Nowe let vs ſee how we ought too make our prayers to God, to wit, our prayers muſt not proceed from the midſt of our mouth, but from a godly minde, and pure truth. This word to cry out, importeth vehemency, as ſhall again ſoone after be ſpoken of. Nowe Dauid meaneth not that he ſtrained his throate to cal and cry out, but he rather ſignifieth that he went not coldly vnto it, as they do which pray vnto God, they know not why nor wherfore, without it be for a faſhion: or if they be preſſed through any neede, yet are they no whit at al rightly moued, bycauſe they doo not aſſure themſelues that hee will heare and receiue them. Dauid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſheweth that he was not ſo blockiſh, but that he had ſuch an earneſt deſire as puſſhed him thereto as S. Paul ſaieth, that when we come to pray vnto God,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> wee ought to approch with groaning harts, which no toung ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expreſſe, by which we are puſſhed forward by the ſpirit of god. Se the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 2. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is required in our prayers, that is, that we muſt lift our harts &amp; minds vp into heauen, when as wee pray vnto God. For we knowing what great need we haue of his help, muſt pray that he wil haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate, yea &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that we are the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if hee ſtretched not foorth his merciful hand vntoo vs: and
<pb facs="tcp:7694:164"/>therefore that hereupon, we ought to ſet out and call vpon him with an earneſt affection. Nowe in the third place Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid telleth vs that he was very dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in praying vnto God: to wit: that he hoped euen vnto the laſt caſt, as there are very many which doe ſo, when as they ſee welynough that they can go no further, except God help them: and yet for all that they ſteppe backe from him as much as in them lyeth, and are neuer carried to the very point, with all their heartes to call vpon God, without it bee that they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will nor chooſe, and are driuen euen too their wittes ends, as we ſay. Dauid declareth that he was not ſo drowſy, for he ſaieth, that he preuented the night watches, that hee occupied him ſelfe, ſeeing that it was the true, and onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of the children of God, and the very faithfull, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them ſelues into his protection. Nowe he laſtly declareth, that he continued it, that it was no ſuddaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or blaſt, and afterward to waxe colde agarne, as ſome do: and I would it pleaſed God that we might not practize it ſo often as wee haue done. But there is not that hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs which hath not founde by experience that wee are by and by tyered in praying to God, and that wee waxe very colde ſo ſoone as we haue poured out one onely ſigh and groane. For we thinke it inough, if we haue ſet down our whole ſumme to God in a worde, a and do ſuppoſe, that if we haue made one onely prayer, that we are diſcharged of all together, and that God will helpe vs, if hee thinke it good. Nowe Dauid ſheweth vnto vs, that hee perſeuered in calling vpon the name of God. Loe heere the foure pointes which we haue to note in this place, to the ende that euery of vs might diſcharge our ſelues of them. For ſee from whence we muſt learne the maner to pray wel: to wit, in the firſt place, not with hauing our mouth going, but we muſt lay open our heartes, and all our affections before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of God, and pray in ſpirituall truth: and not onely ſo, but we muſt alſo be enflamed with ſuch a zeale, as that wee be fully aſſured that he will both heare and helpe vs. And for performance hereof, we muſt be touched to the quick
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7694:164"/>with the knowledge of our ſinnes: and knowe that our eſtate is moſte accurſed, if God hath not pittie on vs: and alſo what the ſaluation is which he hath promiſed vs: wee muſt haue alwayes theſe things in minde, to the ende wee might be the more carefull, watchfully to call vppon him: and not to waite vntill God conſtrayneth vs through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme neceſſities, but to be alwayes in ſuch a readineſſe, as Dauid heere ſpeaketh of, we muſt day and night, and euery minute be occupyed to looke vnto God, and too call vpon him: and to haue this vnderſtanding with vs, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer any of vs ſhall wake in the night, that it be to this end to poure out ſome ſighes vnto our good GOD for our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. And alſo when as wee ſhall be alone by our ſelue, wee muſte doe the like knowing right wel that God ſeeth vs, and that we are alwayes as it were in his preſence. Laſtly we muſt perſeuer heerein, &amp; not take vp the Bucklers, and by and by lay them downe againe, and be ſoone wearyed: But we muſt ſtill continue in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as Dauid heere ſheweth vs an example. Nowe after hee hath made theſe proteſtations, he goeth on and ſayth,</p>
            <q>That after he ſhall be hearde, and ſhall haue obtayned his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, that he wil keepe the teſtimonies of God.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid ſheweth that he will not be vnthankfull for the grace which was beſtowed vpon him. And this is a poynt which ought greatly to be conſidered of by vs. For what is the cauſe that God ſo eaſily graunteth vnto vs whatſoeuer we demaund according to his holy will that he ſo louingly intreateth vs, yea that his hands are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open vnto vs, to the ende liberally to beſtowe his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites and riches vpon vs? Wherefore ſheweth he himſelfe ſo liberall euery way vnto vs? It is to the ende that wee might haue wherefore to yeelde him our heartie thankes, and too glorifie him. Let vs then learne, that it is impoſſible for vs rightly to pray vnto God, except we be already prepared to acknowledge his benefites, and too haue this full reſolute minde that Dauid had: to wit, to glorifie God, when as he ſhall haue hearde our prayers.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:165"/>
            <p>As alſo we ſee theſe two things to goo togither in another place, where it is ſaid, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt gorifie me.</hi> See then what we haue to note vpon this ſaying where Dauid ſayth, <hi>That hee will keepe the ordinaunces and teſtimonyes of God.</hi> But wee are to conſider in the ſeconde place, what the thankes are which God requireth of vs, after he hath holpen vs, &amp; that we haue felt his goodnes in not reiecting our prayers. Now this is true, that it is meete that the mouth doth his office to magnifie the name of God, in confeſſing how greatly we are beholden vnto him: and yet it is not inough that our mouth hath ſpoken, but wee muſte glorifie him with the whole action of our life, and too ſhewe this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, howe greatly we are bounden vnto him, in ſeruing &amp; honowring him in all and through all. Dauid then in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he would giue thanks vnto God becauſe he heard him, ſayth not, that he wold do it only with the mouth, but ſheweth that he will paſſe farther that is, to keepe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of God, and to ſubmit him vnto his ordinaunces.</p>
            <p>See howe the glory of God ought to reſound, not onely at the tounges end of the faithfull, but alſo in the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their handes and feete, and whatſoeuer elſe ought to apply them too honor this good God, that wee ſhould doe him homage all our life longe, conſidering that wee holde all of him: and not onely for our creation, but alſo for our maintenaunce and conſeruation, and for that hee continually ſheweth him ſelfe too be our protector. For there paſſeth not one hower ouer our heads, wherein God deliuereth vs not from one miſchiefe or other. We haue then a large matter to thanke him for, not onely with the mouth and in words: but alſo in making proteſtation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the dayes of our life. Wee ſee nowe the ſumme and effect of that which is heere ſpoken, to witte, <hi>I haue called vppon thee with my whole hart, O heare me, and I will keepe thy Statutes.</hi> And afterwardes, <hi>I haue called vpon thee, ſaue me, and I will keepe thy Teſtimonyes.</hi> And after that, <hi>I haue preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the dawning of the day.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="158" facs="tcp:7694:165"/>
            <p>
               <hi>I haue called vppon thee, yea in truſting in thy worde.</hi> Now heere he againe repeateth the point which wee haue noted in the other Sermon: that is, that for our well praying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, we muſte builde vppon the truſt of his promiſes. And this is the true preparation which wee ought to make, euen ſuch a one as this. It is true that we had neede to feele our miſeryes and neceſſities, as it hath beene before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For wee ſhall neuer pray vnto God with a right affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from the hearte without this. And beſides it is very needefull alſo that we ſo lay open our heartes, as that we come boldely too preſent them before our good God too diſcharge and vnburthen thoſe our heartes of all their cares and ſorrowes. But in the meane while, howe is it poſſible for vs, ſo watchfully and carefully too pray vnto GOD, and to be at full libertie to come before him, if wee had not this hope that hee woulde heare vs? And howe coulde wee haue any hope, if hee had not giuen vs his woorde which witneſſeth vnto vs his will, and certifieth vs that wee ſhall not loſe our labour in praying vnto him? The firſte laying open then which is requiſite for rightly calling vppon GOD, is, that wee come vntoo him in full aſſuraunce that he will heare vs. And why ſo? Becauſe hee hath promiſed vs.</p>
            <p>They then which ſhall pray at all aduenture, ſhall gaine nothing, as the ſcripture ſayeth: For it is doone but in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: when as wee aſſure not our ſelues that God will heare vs. We muſt, as the Apoſtle ſayth, in drawing neere vnto God, knowe that it is GOD which calleth vs vnto him. And they which haue not this knoweledge, ſhall be voyde of their hope. And therefore euery man muſt looke into him ſelfe, to be thus reſolued and ſay, Wel, ſince it is God, that calleth and biddeth me to come vnto him, I muſt not ſtand in doubt of obtayning that which I ſhall aſke of him, yea becauſe I truſt to his woorde. When then wee ſhall be thus fully aſſured, we may very well beginne too pray: But if this be not in vs, we may beſtow great paines in
<pb facs="tcp:7694:166"/>praying vnto God, yea from morning vntill euening: wee may continue all the whole night in babling, but wee ſhall get nothing at all by it: although we had ſome deſire and zeale, we ſhould neuer know what gaine we ſhould haue by our prayers, becauſe wee truſt not to the promiſes of God nor yet ſtay our ſelues vpon them.</p>
            <p>Let vs then not dout but that hee will helpe vs, and that we ſhall feele his ayde in time conuenient. Heereby wee ſee, that we could neuer duely and truely pray vnto God in all the Religion of Popery, I ſay according too that doctrine which they hold. And why ſo? Becauſe they teach the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched world to be alwayes in doubt and wauering. See then that a meere and profeſſed Papiſt can neuer bee able too make one prayer to pleaſe God: and cannot chooſe but to prouoke the wrath of God againſt them ſelues in all their Prayers. And why ſo? Forſomuch as they looke not vnto his promiſes, vpon which we muſt ſettle our ſelues, to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but that which is worſe, they teach that in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they muſt alwayes ſtand in doubt. So much the more then ought this doctrine rightly too be conſidered of vs, where it is declared, that the key which openeth the gate for vs to approch vnto God in calling vppon his name, is this, that we muſt haue the promiſes contained in the holy Scripture, &amp; to learne ſuch an affiaunce out of it, as that we doubt not that God regardeth vs: and that ſo oftentimes as we pray vnto him, that our prayers enter into him, and that he will receiue them, declaring that hee is ready too graunte vnto, vs what ſoeuer wee ſhall craue of him in his ſonnes name according to his wil.</p>
            <p>Nowe in the meane while, becauſe that God ordinarily heareth not vs at the firſt chop, that is to ſay, ſheweth not it according to the outwarde ſhewe, and as we would wiſh, heere is required patience to remaine conſtant in this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, and too retaine and nouriſh it in our heartes after the example of Dauid. For hee ſayth not, that hee prayed onely vnto God for a time: but ſheweth that he continued therein, and that hee preuented the night watches. See
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7694:166"/>then what perſeueraunce was in him as touching prayer. Nowe it is a ſigne that God ſhewed him not too haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned the thing that he prayed for. It falleth out then that Dauid his patience was troubled in that that hee langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: and yet for all that he alwayes truſted to the woorde of God. Nowe wee for our partes are to doe euen the like. For although God ſheweth not himſelf to be mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs ſo ſoone as we would wiſh, and too graunt vs our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, yet ought we notwithſtanding too builde heerevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hee will bee faithfull, and ſhewe him ſelfe ſo in the ende. Although he prolongeth it for a time, he doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth it to be very profitable for vs to humble vs, and to proue our patience. It followeth ſoone after,</p>
            <q>Mine eyes preuent the night watches: that I might be occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy worde.</q>
            <p>This verſe is not put to without cauſe. I haue already ſayd, that we can haue no acceſſe vnto God in our prayers, without we truſt to his word. For it is a very harde matter for vs to ſtay vpon God, if we onely conſider of him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our naturall reaſon, whether he bee neere vs or no, and whether he putteth foorth his hand to help vs. When then we ſhall not perceiue this power and grace of God, as we would wiſhe, it is a very hard thing for vs too beleeue in him, and therefore wee muſt ſtoutely ſtriue in this behalfe. And ſee why Dauid ſayth, <hi>That his eyes preuented the night watch,</hi> to be occupyed in that which might confirme him. As if he ſhould haue ſayde, O Lorde, I haue beleeued thy word, but it was with greate paine, and with many harde conflicts. For I am a weake man, and of mine owne nature inclyned to diſtruſt, and beſides I am aſſayled with a greate number of temptations: But yet haue I remedied all this geere, when as I occupyed my ſelfe aboute this continuall meditation of thy word, which I did not onely beſtowe on the day time, but alſo in parte of the night. See heere what we are in very deede to gather out of this place. But firſt we muſt mark the proceeding of Dauid. For after hee hath ſpoken of the hope wherein he was ſetled, to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
<pb facs="tcp:7694:167"/>God without doubting that he would heare him, hee ſayeth,</p>
            <q>That he carefully meditated on his woord.</q>
            <p>And why did hee ſo? Shall that which was neceſſary for Dauid to doe, bee ſuperfluous for vs? God forbid. For if ſuch a Prophet as hee, had neede too arme himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the temptations of his fleſhe, againſt the infirmities wherwith he might be aſſayled, I pray you how quickly ſhal he be ouerthrowne, if we haue not the ſame remedy which we vſed, and the courage alſo which he heere exhorteth vs vnto?</p>
            <p>Let vs then conſider, that if we will be ſtayed vpon the promiſes of God, becauſe we would call vppon him in the time of neede, we ought many times to meditate vpon his woords both day and night: and to ſet all our ſtudy and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſee what the cauſe is why there are ſo fewe which be diſpoſed to pray vnto God. Yea, and when they are thereto inforced, they knowe not which way too beginne, becauſe they cannot he fully reſolued, to ſay, It is very requiſite that when I ſhall call vpon my good God, that I be fully aſſured that hee will not refuſe to heare me. What is the cauſe of this vncertaintie? It is becauſe they are not wel acquainted with the promiſes of God. For a man will thinke that it were euen inough ſleightly and lightly to beleeue, that God will heare thoſe that are his. And when we come to prayer with this thought, we thinke that if we haue ſaid, but a word or two: that it is too much. Yea and if wee come to a Sermon, and heare the promiſes of God ſpoken of, we thinke it by and by too bee an vnprofitable ſpeach, and will ſay, that it is more then needeth, for what is he that vnderſtandeth not that well inough? And in the meane while, beholde a mightie great temptation, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a boyſterous whirlewinde and tempeſt euen at hande: and then he which thought him ſelfe ſo able a man, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very Milkeſop: He wil looke whether God wil haue pitie of him: He will poſſibly imagine, that he hath turned his back, yea or elſe hee will doubt of his prouidence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7694:167"/>he hath any care of the worlde or no, there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fantaſies which the Deuill goeth about to put in our mindes. And when we are in this caſe, ſee we are ſo aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that there is no comming for vs too pray vnto God. And what is the reaſon? It is becauſe wee haue not beene carefull to meditate vpon his promiſes.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ought ſo much the more, throughly to conſider of this leſſon, when as it is ſaid, That Dauid his eyes preuented the night watches, too meditate vppon the promiſes of God. Let vs nowe compare our ſelues with him. But it is ſo farre of that any of vs in particular hath this care, whereof mention is heere made, as that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any meanes poſſible bee trayned vnto it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God biddeth vs to come vnto him, yet cannot wee be brought to come any thinge neere him. See howe the Bel ſhal ring euery day to moue vs to come to the Sermon: God there telleth vs of his will, hee declareth vnto vs that he is ready to receiue vs to his mercie, as often as wee ſhall call vpon him.</p>
            <p>Nowe euery of vs may very well ſee, that wee paſſe not of his helpe one minute of an houre. And yet howe many are there notwithſtanding which will vouchſafe too ſteppe one foote, too come to occupy them ſelues aboute the promiſes of God, that their memoryes might be refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in them to thend they might ſo much the better be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of them? Nay we ſhall ſarcely haue a number of them com to it on the Sunday, yea, and if percaſe they come once, they thinke it too bee as it were ouer much. And forſooth they muſte not come thither neither euery Sunday, becauſe their eares will bee ouer much filled with noyſe: and againe ſuch as doe come too it, with what affection come they, thinke you? Verely, becauſe that they cannot deny, but that there muſt bee one day in the weeke for them to meete togither: and beſides, they will for once come thither: but it ſhall be to ſleepe, ſo that they vnderſtand and carry away aſmuch as theſe pillers, or elſe the ſtoles whereon they ſit.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:168"/>
            <p>Loe heere, howe a great number of the people come to the Sermon. Yea and there are no ſmall number which wil come thither, euen to mock God, as we ſee theſe ſcoffers and gibers, who come to none other ende, but too diſpite him, bring with them whoriſhe and ſhameleſſe faces, and ſuch a beaſtly impudencie as cannot bee greater. All this we ſee. Nowe let vs conſider that it is ſo farre of that our ſlouthfulneſſe ſhould be excuſed, as that God cannot but iuſtly puniſh vs, in that we ſhall be depriued of the abilitie to call vpon him in our neede, and ſhall haue our mouthes alſo ſtopped. And afterwarde the miſchiefe ſhall increaſe dayly more and more, vntill ſuch time as we are come euen to the deapth of the bottomleſſe pittes: that is to ſay, wee ſhall be vtterly excluded from the help of our good God, that he will retire him ſelfe from vs, and cleerely baniſh vs his kingdome. Beholde heere the fruite which commerh by our negligence, when as we ſhall make no accounte of the exerciſing of our ſelues in this ſtudy of the promiſes of God. Nowe Dauid addeth,</p>
            <q>Heare my voyce, O Lord, at cording vnto thy louing kindenes: quicken me according to thy iudgement.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid declareth yet more plainly, vppon what ground he layde his foundation of praying vnto God: to wit, he brought no kinde of preſumption with him, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to make account of this or that, and ſo to be thought very woorthy that God ſhould heare him: but he preferred the goodneſſe and faithfulneſſe of God aboue all his owne woorthineſſes. Loe heere, wherevnto wee muſt looke if wee wil haue God to be merciful vnto vs. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we would profite our ſelues by our prayers, wee muſt not once talke of bringing in of any thing of ours with vs, ne yet alledge this thing nor that, as thinking too binde God vnto vs for ſome good turne that wee haue doone him: but too haue this principall regarde with vs, God is good, and faithfull, and iuſt.</p>
            <p>See then wheron it is that we muſt ſettle our confidence, if we will be reſolued that he will heare vs. And this is ſuch
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7694:168"/>a doctrine, I tell you, aswe ought well to holde and keepe. For in very deede, vnder this worde, Promiſe, this muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither be vnder ſtoode. For what is it that induceth God to helpe vs, and to ſaye, come vnto me, without hee looke that wee would craue ſomething at his handes? What is the cauſe that our God preſenteth himſelfe thus vnto vs? Are they our merites? haue we any wayes on our parte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that he ſhoulde be ſo louing and kinde vnto vs? No without all doubt. We muſt then needes conclude, that the promiſes do ſpring out from this fountaine euen his meere mercie. And therefore it is not without cauſe that Dauid, after hee hath ſpoken of the promiſes of God, declareth heere that he deſireth not to bee heard, but in this reſpect, <hi>That God is good and merciful.</hi> As if he ſhoulde haue ſayde, O Lorde, if any man inquire the cauſe why thou haſt hearde me, and haſte pittie on me, I am able to ſay nothing as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching mine owne perſon, but that I iuſtly deſerue too bee reiected of thee, but thou haſt taken the matter and cauſe vnto thine owne goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe. Now it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth ſoone after,</p>
            <q>
               <p>They drawe nighe that follow after malice: and are farre from thy lawe.</p>
               <p>Thou art nigh at hand, O Lord: for all thy commaundements are true.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Heere Dauid complayneth vnto God, and deſireth him to helpe him againſt the wicked and vngodly contemners of his maieſtie: As if he had ſaid vnto him, O Lorde, I can alledge nothing at all for mine one defence, but that they which draw nigh vnto me to hurt me, are ſo much the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of from thy lawe, and I the neerer thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments It is a commonen entendement, that they which doe imagine ma1ice, are farre from God, in withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from his lawe: but when as wee ſhall narrowly looke into the matter, that is the very true and naturall ſenſe of the Prophet which I haue already touched, that they which imagine malice or deceit, are farre off: that is, they are rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the lawe of God, to perſecute thoſe which drawe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:169"/>nigh vnto it. And ſee how Dauid hath taken for his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that, that the wicked are farre from God, bicauſe hee did very well ſee, that he had beene ouerthrowne through their malice, without God had holpen him. Which thing he ſheweth by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint, that the wicked troubled him euen to the vttermoſt. And ſo much the more ought wee to conſider of this, bicauſe we being ſo woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſh as poſsibly may be, do by &amp; by think that if the wicked beare the ſway, and craftily goe about too deuiſe any thing againſt vs, that all is loſte, and that God hath giuen vs ouer for a ſpoile. We can in no wiſe abide that God ſhould exerciſe our patience nor yet humble vs. Let vs then throughly confider of the example of Dauid. For although that God had ſpecially choſen him out, amongſt the reſt, and had beſtowed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent graces vpon him: yet for all that hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that the vngodly ſhoulde perſecute him, neither could he make them ſtande aloofe off, for hee had neither Rampares or Bulwarkes, that he was able to ſaye, you ſhall not come neare me. For he ſaieth that they drew nigh him. So then, when God giueth ſuch leaue to the wicked, as too haue the raines at will, ſo that it ſhould ſeeme, that they had the power euen to ſet their feete on our throates, yea and to ſwallowe vs cleane vp, Let vs conſider, that it hath beene the will of our God in all ages, to haue his children ſubiect to the malice of their enemies. Let vs alſo haue a further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this which he ſayeth, that they are farre from the lawe of God. For this importeth, that they neither had truthe nor equitie in them. When then the vngodly, ſhall with the contempt of God, and an extreeme impietie, euen ruſhe vpon vs to ouerthrowe vs, let vs then, I ſay, remember the example of Dauid and ſaye, wherefore doe the wicked thus perſecute vs, without any regarde too him, who ought and will when it pleaſeth him both with force and violence repreſſe them? It is bicauſe they are both blynde and blockiſh, and are without all truthe and equitie. But on the contrary ſide, let vs not be afearde, bicauſe wee knowe that God is nigh vs: &amp; let vs continually cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, to the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7694:169"/>ende he may be alwayes nearer and nearer vnto vs, too put him ſelfe betwixt vs, and make him ſelfe our buckler to put backe the attemptes, and to beare the blowes wherewith the wicked ſhal aſſail vs. Moreouer, let vs beſure &amp; reſolute, that notwithſtanding that the vngodly ſhall thus oppreſſe vs, yet that God is not farre from vs, although that we can not perceiue it. For God will oftentimes be neare vs, when as we ſhall thinke that he is cleane hidden: that is to ſay, he ſheweth not vnto vs his power and vertue, neither laieth he it open at the firſt chop. For we muſt alſo call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, that we might ſhew what honour wee beare him: that although hee prolongeth the time, and tarrieth longer before hee helpe vs, then we would, yet muſt we notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding tarry his good leiſure. In ſumme we muſt alwayes bee reſolute in this which Dauid here ſpeaketh of, ſaying, are the vngodly nighe? very well, and God is at hand. That is to ſay, God is not aſleepe in heauen, whiles theſe men are maliciouſly imagining to do vs hurte. God his armes are not a croſſe, neither are his handes cloſed, notwithſtanding that theſe men ſeeke nothing els but to deuoure vs. God is not yet blynde, whyles theſe vngodly awake, to deſtroye and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde vs. Se then howe God, according to the neceſsities which he knoweth to be in vs, will alwayes be at hande, ſo to aſsiſt vs, as that whatſoeuer miſchiefe is neare vs, it ſhall neuer be able to ouercome vs, yea, inuent the wicked what they can on all ſides. This is it that Dauid meaneth to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in this place.</p>
            <p>Nowe he alſo ſayeth, <hi>That the commaundements of God are true.</hi> Wherein he exhorteth vs to haue recourſe vnto the worde of God, for although wee are thus tormented and faſt cloſed vp in ſorrowe and griefes: yea and that we looke this way and that way for helpe, and yet ſee not God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie the ſame: then I ſaye, hee teacheth vs too haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto his worde. And this is a moſt profitable admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. For when we ſeeke after God, we muſt not haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to our own fantaſies, nor to any worldly maner, as we are accuſtomed, nor too looke that hee ſubmit him ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:170"/>vnto our will, to ſhewe him ſelfe vnto vs after a viſible ſort, to haue him come downe from heauen in his maieſtie, too conſume with fire and brimſtone all our enemies, to ſet vs aloft, and to beare vs ſuch fauour, as that wee might haue all things at our owne deſire: Loe I beſeech you howe wee deſire to haue GOD to ſhewe him ſelfe, for like as wee are fleſhly, ſo alſo would we haue him to ſhew him ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in a viſible maner. All this while, his worde is of no great authoritie with vs: for if hee ſhewe vs not why and wherefore, we are not contented with that which hee hath ſpoken, but we would forſooth ſee his hande altogether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Wherefore, this admonition which Dauid here giueth vs, is very neceſſary: to wit, that the commandementes of God are true. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, O Lorde, I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, that thou art neare vnto vs, for as much as thou ſeeſt vs to bee perſecuted and troubled by the wicked, and how they come vpon vs to deſtroye vs, and that thou arte right before them and againſt them to beate them backe, and to beare their blowes. All this do I confeſſe, O Lorde, But yet I vee not this after a viſible &amp; worldly maner. Howe then? It is bicauſe thy commaundements are true. Dauid then knewe that God was neare vnto him, bicauſe hee ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled him ſelfe vpon the lawe, and the promiſes which were giuen him. And euen ſo muſt we do, although it ſeeme very hard, as we haue already touched. It followeth,</p>
            <q>I haue knowne long ſince by teſtimonies: that thou haſt grounded them for euer.</q>
            <p>In this latter verſe, for a concluſion, Dauid ſayeth, that he was not like a nouice, to bee nowe too learne to knowe what the commaundements of God were, but hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute that God was neare him, bicauſe hee had his worde, from which he could not ſtarte. He ſheweth then, that the faithfull ought not too bee as it were in their A. B. C. but muſt bee long time exerciſed: as Dauid proteſteth of him ſelfe, I haue knowne them, ſayeth hee, long ſince.</p>
            <p>Now here he ſetteth downe a woorde which ſignifieth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7694:170"/>continuaunce: <hi>From the beginning haue I knowen</hi> ſaieth hee, <hi>long ſince thy commaundements which thou haſte grounded for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, let vs learne that if wee will boldely ſtriue againſt all the aſſaultes, wherewith wee may bee aſſayled, wee muſte continue in this knowledge of the woorde of God, and we ſhall alwayes finde him ready to be neerehand vs: ſo that we may be ſure of his protection, not for a day onely but all the dayes of our life. And ſo let vs through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recorde this leſſon, to the ende we may ſay with Dauid, that wee haue the teſtimonyes of GOD ſo deepely imprinted in our heartes, as that wee haue longe time ſince knowen what is already in them, too witte, that God hath eſtabliſhed them: That is to ſay, that although we ſhall ſee a great number of chaunges in this world, that all things are chaunged and turned, yet that God is no chaungeling, that hee neuer altereth his minde, that his woorde is, as it was from the beginning, and as it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for euer: that it ſhall neuer be ſubiect to al the turnes and chaunges of this worlde, but ſhall euer abide in his ful ſtrength and vertue, becauſe that God hath eſtabliſhed it for euer. And this is euen ſo, as that we ought to bee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to call vpon God, to witte, when as we ſhall be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon the true confidence of his promiſes: that we ſhall haue knowne the euerlaſting power &amp; ſtrength which he hath giuen to his woorde: that is, that he will remaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes like vnto him ſelfe. When, I ſay, wee ſhall haue knowen this, we may boldely come and preſent our ſelues before him, beeing aſſured that hee will make vs feele by proofe, that which he promiſeth vs, ſo oftentimes as wee ſhall haue recourſe vnto him, truſting heerein that he hath rendered vnto vs a teſtimonie of the loue which hee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the Maieſtie of our good God, and father, in acknowledging our innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable offences, which wee dayly commit againſt him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
<pb facs="tcp:7694:171"/>him that he will ſo touch vs, as that in ſteede that wee haue beene ouer much giuen to our fleſhly affections, and vanities of this world, that nowe we ſeeke none other way but wholy too order our ſelues according to his good will, beeing aſſured that although we bee feeble and weake, yea and vtterly voyde of all ſtrength, ſo that wee cannot ſtepe one foote forwarde without ſtumbling, or elſe in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backwarde we bee farre from him, yet let vs not doute but that hee will be neere at hand too helpe vs: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that when hee hath made vs too feele his helpe, that he will giue vs that grace that wee may bee ſo thankfull vnto him, as hee deſerueth, deſiring nothing elſe but too glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him all the dayes of our life, for ſo many his benefites as he dayly giueth vs, and liberally beſtoweth vpon vs.</p>
            <p>That hee will not onely graunt vnto vs this grace, but alſo vnto all people and nations of the earth. &amp;c.</p>

And this is it that man naturally deſireth. But in the meane while wee are to conſider, that God wil exerciſe vs with diuerſe afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo long as we are in this worlde. Wherefore ſuch is the condition and ſtate of Chriſtians, ſo long as they ſhall liue heere vpon the earth: That is, they muſt ſtriue, &amp; be exerciſed with diuerſe ſortes of greeues, ſometimes of the body, and otherwhiles of the ſoule. And therefore for this cauſe muſt we arme our ſelues to the ende we be not ouercome in the mideſt of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts. Now the principal peece of our armour is, to pray vn-God, and to call vpon him to helpe vs. And to bring this about, we are throughly to conſider howe all the faithfull which liued long before our time, proceeded heerein, too the ende we might order our ſelues after their example, as in this texte heere, we ſee howe Dauid was euen extreemely afflicted. Againe, wee ſee alſo howe he behaued him ſelfe in all his afflictions, which although they were very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet did they not hinder him too haue recourſe vntoo God, and of him he was reſcued and ſaued. See then what we haue to meditate vppon, too the ende that wee might doe the like.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:172"/>
            <q>Beholde mine affliction, and deliuer me: for I doe not forget thy lawe.</q>
            <p>When as he deſireth God to looke vnto his afflictions, it is euen the ſame which wee haue already ſaide: too wit, That although God loued him, yet would he not but that he ſhould be ſubiect, too a greate number of miſeryes, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and griefes. Let vs not think then to be priuiledged, ſo long as we are to walke heere bilowe on the earth, but that God will exerciſe vs and aſſay and proue our patience, as he hath prooued Dauids, whome he ſo greatly loued, as the ſcripture witneſſeth of him.</p>
            <p>Nowe heere we are to note two things, The one is, that when Dauid deſired God to looke vpon his afflictions, and to deliuer him out of them: hee confeſſeth that hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonyed, as if God had turned his backe vpon him. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, that Dauid conſidered not of all that was too bee conſidered neither did he conclude, that God would caſt off his children in ſuch ſorte: But yet ſo farre forth as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon coulde reach, ſee howe he might iudge of his eſtate.</p>
            <p>And at that pointe alſo are all the Children of God. For on the one ſide, when as they ſhall looke vppon their owne ſtate and condition, they cannot choſe but that they muſt be forced to ſay, what a thing is this, Surely, if God hath any compaſſion vpon vs, and that he ſeeth vs, is it poſſible that euer wee ſhould bee thus cruelly handled, will not he take ſome better order for this: See then, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe, but to conceiue theſe and ſuch like imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our heartes, when as wee are greeued and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and looke into our owne preſent eſtate: yea, euen as I haue already ſayde, we cannot chooſe euen too feele our ſelues as it were to be forſaken of GOD. And yet for all this, wee muſte bee fully perſwaded and reſolued, that GOD beholdeth vs: and although it ſeemeth, that hee hath turned his backe vppon vs, yet that hee ceaſeth not too helpe vs, and is carefull for our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7694:172"/>yea and though wee ſee nothing, yet let vs holde this for a certaine and an vndoubted trueth, in oure heartes. And therfore ſo often as we ſhall be thus troubled to thinke that God hath no lenger care ouer vs, but that he hath clerely forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, yet let not this hinder vs from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after the example of Dauid: neither let vs be ſlacke, but euen ſay, O Lord, beholde me. In the ſecond place we haue to note, the reaſon which Dauid here ſetteth downe. For I do not forget thy lawe. If then wee will haue God to heare vs, wee muſt haue his lawe as it were fully ſettled in our heartes. And howe is that? Forſooth, wee muſt thinke and ſtudy vpon his promiſes, we muſt know him to bee louing and mercifull, to helpe all thoſe that are his, and too ayde them in all their neceſsities, and beſides, this muſt bee oure ſure foundation that his promiſes are infallible, and that he will not ſuffer his children to goe emptie away, when as they ſhall tende them ſelues thereto.</p>
            <p>See then how we muſt meditate vpon the lawe of God that is to ſay, vpon his word. For vnder this worde, the law, there is no doubt, but that Dauid comprehended the ſumme of al the doctrine which God gaue vnto his church. Euery of vs then muſt be exerciſed in this ſtudy, and we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the lawe thus imprinted in our heartes, may bee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſure that God beholdeth vs, and will helpe vs in all our afflictions: yea although it ſeemeth, and wee may iudge according to our carnall ſenſes, that hee hath turned his backe vpon vs, or that he hath cloſed vp his eyes, and ſleepeth, and as a man would ſaye, neuer thinketh more of vs. Now it followeth in the ſecond verſe,</p>
            <q>Pleade my cauſe and deliuer me: quicken me according vnto thy worde.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid expreſſeth what this his affection is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee hath ſpoken: too wit, howe that the wicked vniuſtly perſecuted him, as againe hereafter ſhall more at large bee declared. Now wee knowe, that the griefes which the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God doe ſuffer in this worlde, are diuerſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie: For ſometimes God will lay heauy hande vppon
<pb facs="tcp:7694:173"/>them, without any man his touching: ſometimes alſo men ſhall perſecute them with vniuſt actions, ſo that the wicked ſhall torment and grieue them. Dauid then ſheweth that the affliction which he endured, was of this ſecond kinde, to wit: that hee had enemies which did vniuſtly trouble him. And ſee wherefore hee deſireth God, too pleade his cauſe, and reſtore him. By this wee are admoniſhed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which I haue already ſaide, that when we haue liued in a good conſcience, and haue trauelled euen to doe good vnto euery man, ſo that no man hath any cauſe iuſtly to complaine of vs, yet although wee are perſecuted and troubled wee muſt not for all that bee ouermuch abaſhed: bicauſe as great matters as al theſe were layde vpon Dauid. For this is moſt ſure, that hee walked ſo marueilous ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as that euery man had occaſion too loue him. And yet notwithſtanding hee was not without troubles amongeſt men. And why ſo? Bicauſe of their vnthankefulneſſe. Let vs then vnderſtande that this vice began not firſt in theſe dayes, (I meane the vnthankefulneſſe and iniquitie of men:) But long time a goe, and therefore as much as in vs lyeth, let vs ſeeke after peace: but if ſo be wee ſhall procure to doe any wrong, the worlde will neuer giue ouer hating of vs, and procuring of our hurte, yea, and goe about euen to deſtroye vs. But as I haue already ſaide, let not that ſeeme ſtraunge vnto vs, ſeeing it came ſo to paſſe in Dauid. And thus much for this. Nowe in the ſecond place, wee are to beſeeche God too auenge our cauſe, too comfort vs, when we ſee our ſelues to be wrongfully dealt withal, when as we are oppreſſed with falſe and ſlaunderous reportes, that we are euill ſpoken of without iuſt deſert: we muſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſire God to be our warrant and deliuerer: and let vs not dout but that he will take our cauſe into his owne hand, &amp; ſhewe him ſelfe to be more then a protector &amp; lawyer. For he ſaieth that he is the aduerſe partie for the maintenance and defence of the cauſes and quarrels of all his, when as they ſhall haue walked ſincerely before him ſelfe &amp; before men. Loe here a notable, and very profitable admonition:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7694:173"/>That is, we muſt caſt all our care vpon God, when as we are wrongfully accuſed, iniuriouſly dealt withall, troubled, and oppreſſed: and beſeech God to take the cauſe into his own hand, and to auenge it him ſelfe. Nowe this may ſerue too make vs patient: for what is the cauſe that men ſo trouble and torment them ſelues, waxe ſo fierce, and cruell, vſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, or els, growe to be very cowardes when any wrong is done them, but bicauſe that they haue not recourſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, put not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vnder his protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; pray him not, to holde his holy hand ouer them, and to defend their cauſe? Now if wee knowe this, it is moſt certaine, that oure heartes ſhall incontinent bee a great deale more quiet, and let vs not haue ſuch boyling affections as wee haue, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of them which trouble vs, but let vs followe the doctrine which is here ſet downe vnto vs: to wit, that when we are vniuſtly entreated, let vs pray vnto God that he will auenge our cauſe. And beſides alſo, let vs learne to ſtay our ſelues of the promiſe, which is made vnto vs thereof: for like as a Dauid maketh here ſuch a requeſt, ſo alſo we are to conſider, that he made it not of his owne head, nor at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, but he knewe it to bee the office of God: That is, <hi>That he will auenge all outrages,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exo.</hi> 15.</note> as it is ſaid in the ſong of Moyſes, <hi>That if men oppreſſe any vniuſtly, our Lord ſayeth, that it is be which auengeth the cauſe of the innocent, and of him that is troubled without a cauſe.</hi> Dauid then knowing, that God hauing taken this title vnto him ſelfe, and declared that he will not ſuffer the throates of the righteous too bee thus cut, to be tormented, and troaden vnderfoote, but that hee will ſtretche foorth his hand too helpe them: hee hauing knowne this calleth vpon God with a ſure conſtancie, that will receiue him. Wherefore it is meete that we looke vnto this promiſe when as wee praye, to the ende wee praye not doubtfully but in full aſſurance, that God will be inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ready to helpe our neceſsities. And this is it why Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid by and by after ſayeth, Quicken mee according vnto thy worde. It is not without cauſe that this ſaying was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For as I haue already ſaid, when as we will beſeeche the
<pb facs="tcp:7694:174"/>the lorde our God to take vpon him our quarrell, and too aſsiſte vs in our afflictions: and then we in the meane time ſhall ſtand in doubte of his ſo doing, wee ſhall profite our ſelues little in ſo praying. But we muſt bee fully aſſured that he will deliuer vs. And whenſoeuer it ſhall come too paſſe, that we ſhalbe deſtitute of all mens ayde, yea that it ſhall ſeeme that all the whole worlde had conſpired our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and decay, then ſhould we chieflieſt aſſure our ſelues, that God will auenge our cauſe: and not onely ſerue vs in ſteade of a proctour, but will be altogether alſo our iudge, &amp; aduerſe partie againſt our enemies, and againſt all thoſe which haue vniuſtly afflicted vs. For he it is that muſt take in hand all iuſt cauſes. Wee had neede then too aſſure our ſelues of this. But from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhal we learne this? euen out of the worde of God, bicauſe hee hath lefte vnto vs a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie thereof in it: as wee ſee that Dauid ſpeaketh not here at a wilde adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, but hath already grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him ſelf vpon a good foundation, whereon he hath ſettled him ſelf. Now it followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saluation is farre from the vngodly: bicauſe they ſeeke not thy ſtatutes.</hi> And afterwarde hee ſayeth, <hi>Great are thy tender mercies, O Lorde: quicken me, according to thy iudgementes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe here are two thinges to bee conſidered off. The one is, that Dauid telleth the reaſon why all the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of God, and all that rebell againſt his maieſtie runne headlong into deſtruction, and that hee forſaketh them: that they feele no taſte nor eaſe in their afflictions, but that God clerely forſaketh them. Dauid ſetteth downe here the cauſe of all this: it is, ſaith he, bicauſe they haue not ſought after thy lawes, and therefore are farre from thy ſaluation. Nowe he cleane contrary, proteſteth of him ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee followed the lawe of God, and kept it in his heart. So then we muſt needes conclude, that he could not be eſtraunged from it. In very deede, this ſentence at the firſt ſight is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what darke, but I will make it plaine in three woordes, and then by little and little ſhewe what doctrine wee are too ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of this. When any telleth vs of our ſaluation, wee
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7694:174"/>muſt in the firſt place know, whence it proceedeth: to wit, from God, and that there is no ſaluation but in him: in ſo much that ſo long as God is good and gracious vnto vs, it muſt needes be that all muſt goe very well on our ſide, and be aſſured that our life is bleſſed, and that we ſhall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is meete for our welfare and felicitie. So then, our ſaluation, and all fulneſſe and perfection of benefites conſiſt in this one onely pointe, that God loueth vs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth vs vnto himſelfe. And ſince it is ſo, let vs nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what he is whome God will forſake. Once, we are his creatures, and euen as he hath created and faſhioned vs, ſo alſo will he continne his goodneſſe towards vs. Now, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his mercie extendeth euen to brute beaſts, euen to the moſte vile and abiect thinges, yea euen which wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, and diſdaine once to looke on, ſeeing the mercie of God extendeth ſo farre, as the holy Scripture teacheth vs, how can it be that he wil forſake vs, yea vnto whom he hath graunted ſo great dignitie and excellencie? For wee haue a thing excelling all other his creatures, which is this, that God hath imprinted-his owne ſimilitude and likeneſſe, in vs: Now when as he hath exalted vs vnto ſo highe a degree of honor, will he, thinke you, now forſake vs? Hee will not without all doubt. What is the cauſe then that wee ſee ſo many caitifes, and miſerable wretches which are eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giuen ouer, ſo that God ſendeth them not ſo much as the leaſte ayde and comfort, that it ſeemeth, that he hath ſet them as it were vpon a ſtage, to be a ſhame and rebuke to the whole worlde? Whence commeth this? Forſooth becauſe they withdrawe them ſelues from God: for when as they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe not them ſelues from him: it is moſt ſure that then he ſhewed him ſelfe vnto them, ſuch a one as indeede hee is of his owne nature, that is, louing, kinde pitifull, gentle, &amp; mercifull. To be ſhort, ſo long as we will be ordered by him as his children, it is moſt ſure, that he will play the parte of a father towards vs: ſo long as we will yeelde our obedience vnto him, he wil intreate vs gently. But when we are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe as that wee will not ſubmitte our ſelues neither, vnto
<pb facs="tcp:7694:175"/>him ſelfe, nor yet vnto his word, but contemne his loue &amp; grace offered vnto vs: is it reaſon that God ſhould put forth his hand to helpe vs? is it meete he ſhould entreat vs as his children, and accompt vs in the number of thoſe which wholy dedicate them ſelues vnto his maieſtie? No not ſo. But we rather are worthy to be ſet farre from him, and too haue nothing at all to do with him. Loe here the meaning of Dauid in this place, when he ſaieth, <hi>O Lord, helth is farre from the vngodly bicauſe they regard not thy ſtatutes:</hi> As if hee ſhould haue ſaid, we ought not to be abaſhed, O Lorde, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou giueſt vs ouer, and that we feele no ſuccoure of thy goodnes, but that we languiſh in al miſerie and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. And why ſo? Bicauſe wee haue forſaken and refuſed thy grace: and therefore of very right we ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and come to naught. Now I pray you tell vs, what meaneth it that God will not be nigh vs, but by meanes of his word? we muſt needes feele his goodnes by the effect, yea forſooth, and yet God commeth nigh vnto vs by his word: for that is a preparatiue by which he faſhioneth our heartes, to the ende he might ſhewe him ſelfe to be a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full father vnto vs. And ſo he maketh an entrance into our heartes for his mercie, that we might be capable to enioye his benefites. Seeing then it is ſo, that God by his worde, ſheweth him ſelfe and alſo commeth nigh vnto vs, we muſt not be abaſhed, although they which refuſe his worde, yea, which ſo vilananouſly and contemptuouſly reiect it, as wee ſee: we muſt not, I ſay, thinke it ſtraunge, although that they feele no help at the hand of God in their afflictions, &amp; that his mercifull goodneſſe ſtretcheth not it ſelfe vnto them. Now Dauid returneth to this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which we haue ſeene, and deſireth to be quickened according vnto the worde of God. It is very true he vſeth the word, <hi>Iudgement,</hi> but al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to one, as we haue already heretofore declared. <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me then according to thy iudgements,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>yea which I have loued.</hi> But yet notwithſtanding, he ſheweth vs how it is that God hath promiſed to quicken vs, and why hee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth it vnto his onely mercie.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:7694:175"/>
            <p>Nowe this is a ſaying which importeth a very good and excellent leſſon: for they which confeſſe, that they can not be ſaued but by the grace of God, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding how ſoeuer it is, they ceaſe not to ouerthrow the grace of God, in extolling their merites, or els in making them ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God hath promiſed them to bee ſo kinde vnto them, bicauſe they haue deſerued it. It is requiſite then that we know with Dauid, what it is that hath moued and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp God to promiſe to quicken vs: to wit, to mainteine vs. For this worde to Quicken, importeth all whatſoeuer concerneth our eſtate &amp; ſaluation. It is bicauſe he is good, and neuer ſought the cauſe otherwiſe but in his goodneſſe. When then we are enforced to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that it is God which mainteineth vs, we muſt alſo forthwith confeſſe that God hath done it for his promiſe ſake, and for that he hath reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it as a teſtimonie in his worde. Moreouer, ſee wherein a great number of people are too too groſſely deceiued: that is, that God promiſeth too mainteine and conſerue vs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as we are worthy thereof, or accordingly as euery man ſhall deſerue. And herevpon, as I haue already ſaid, we darken the grace of God, and faine through arrogancie, I know not what preſumption, that it ſeemeth, that wee our ſelues are the cauſe why God fauoureth vs, and that the ſame commeth at the leaſt, partely of our ſelues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought ſo much the more throughly to conſider of that which Dauid ſpeaketh of in this place. <hi>Thy mercies, O Lord, are great, O quicken me according to thy teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſayeth not onely, O Lord, I am conſerued by thee, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt promiſed: but meaning to declare that it commeth altogether freely, hee ſheweth that God was not moued too make any ſuch promiſe, ne yet was induced by any occaſion that he found in vs, or that he tooke it on our behalf. No, no: but bicauſe his mercies are great. So then, by this ſaying Dauid teacheth vs, that the promiſes of God are altogether free, that they hang not of our worthineſſe, ne yet bicauſe God found ſome thing in vs, why to loue &amp; ſuccour vs ſo: but bicauſe he is good, &amp; pitieth our miſeries.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:176"/>
            <p>Loe what made him to offer himſelfe ſo liberall to vs, &amp; conſequently to perfourme his promiſe. Wee muſt learne then to glorifie our ſelues in the meere grace of God, and not to attribute any thing whatſoeuer, either to our owne perſons, or yet to our merites, for there is nothing at all in vs. Nowe it followeth,</p>
            <q>Many there are that trouble and perſecute me: yet doe I not ſwarue from thy teſtimonies.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid maketh a proteſtation and complaint, too the ende God might the rather encline him ſelfe to heare, and helpe him. And that is, according too that which hee hath already ſaid. For if we will haue God to helpe vs, it is good reaſon that wee ſhould patiently attende his leiſure. And in very deede hee that ſhall preſume to aduaunce him ſelfe, or thinketh that God will haue mercy vpon him, and then letteth him ſelfe to be ouercome with temtation, and becommeth altogether deſperate: hee by this meanes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not God too exerciſe his goodneſſe as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: but in thus doing, ſhutteth the gate againſt God as it were. Wherefore if wee be moued to be reuenged of our enemies, to be our owne caruers, as we ſay, in reuenge and not tary vntill God doth his office, doe we thinke that hee ought to helpe vs? Hee that will doe iuſtice with his owne hand, and of his owne priuate authoritie, will hee come to craue aide of the Magiſtrate, after that hee hath killed his enemy? If ſo be then there be any man which thinketh to be ſaued of him ſelfe, and yet ſayeth vnto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saue me O Lorde, this a very mockery. And therefore for this cauſe Dauid ſaieth in this place, <hi>Many there are, O Lorde, which trouble and perſecute me: yet do I not ſwarue from thy ſtatutes.</hi> Dauid ſpeaketh not here to boaſt him ſelfe, but it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he wayted for the help of God: and putting him ſelfe vnder his protection, truſted to obteine his requeſt, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might boldely craue it of him. See then what a full boldnes we may conceiue to haue in calling vpon God, &amp; not to dout but that we ſhal obtain whatſoeuer we pray for vnto him according to his wil: that is, he hath pitie of vs: ſo
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7694:176"/>that, I ſay, we muſt alwayes ſtay our ſelues vpon his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as we ſee Dauid here hath done. So then, let vs here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the firſt place, that ſo often as we come vnto God, we muſt come vnto him attending his good leyſure, and not to be ſhaken with what ſoeuer temptations ſhall come vnto vs, but we muſt alwaies ſeeke after God, meditate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vpon his promiſes, &amp; haue them alwayes in minde: we muſt, I ſay, haue all this, if we will haue God to help and defende vs. Now, as I haue already ſaid, Dauid bragged not here of his vertues, but meaneth onely that hee was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the iniquitie of men, to be euen with them, or to crie quittance, as wee ſay, that hee was not in haſte to haue that which was promiſed him, but helde him ſelfe continually quiet and ſtill, attending pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to haue God to accompliſhe that which he had promiſed, touching the reuenge of his enemies: euen ſo, when as any ſhall grieue &amp; trouble vs, yet muſt we not leaue to followe our vocation, and to perſeuer in the feare of God. For the greater part of vs will alwayes be full of malice and vnthankefulneſſe, vntil ſuch time as God hath refourmed vs. So then, when as wee ſhall not haue hurt any man, if they ryſe vp againſt vs in armes, let vs not be aſtonied thereat. And thus much for this. Nowe the other is, that when our enemies ſhalbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in number, wee muſt not be troubled for all this: but let vs knowe what the power of God is, and glorifie him as he ought to be glorified. And this is a very neceſſary point for vs to learne: For wee muſt not bee afeard of our owne ſhadowes, as we ſay. And therefore, if there be two or three men which are in credit and authoritie, that ſhall make warre againſt vs, wee are ſo faint hearted before the blowe come, as that it ſemeth vnto vs that we are vtterly vndone: euen as though God were not ſtrong enough to helpe vs. See how we through fond ignoraunce glorie in the power of men, and vtterly ouerthrowe the power and might of God, And therefore wee ought a great deale the better to conſider of this place, where it is ſaide, <hi>Many there are, O Lord, which trouble and perſecute me: yet doe I not ſwarue from
<pb facs="tcp:7694:177"/>thy lawe, neither yet haue I forgotten it:</hi> That is to ſaye, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee ſee an infinite number of people too riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, that wee ſee a generall conſpiracie of the whole world, and of all the creatures therein, yet let vs not be too too much afeard, knowing that the power of our God ſhal be ſufficient inough to ſaue &amp; defend vs. See what we haue to note out of this place, where it is ſaid, <hi>It grieued me when I ſawe the tranſgreſſors: bicauſe they kept not thy lawe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Dauid ſheweth that, which we haue already ſeene before: to wit, that it greeued him more, to ſee the offences which were committed againſt God, then all the outrages which he bare in his owne perſon. And this is alſo it, which we ought to haue in great recommendation. For if we bee ſo fine and as it were womanniſh, that wee can abide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet in the meane while haue no care howe God is diſhonoured, his iuſtice violated, and his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments broken: I beſeech you do we not right well ſhewe, that wee are ſo giuen too pleaſe our ſelues, as that wee euen contemne his ſacred maieſtie. If a man, meaning to defende his honour euen with tooth and nayle as we ſaye, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no accompt too ſee the glorie of God troden vnder feete: if he bee ſo gallant and hawtie, as to bee reuenged for euery iniurie, and can abide too heare the holy name of God to be euill ſpoken off, his lawe to be caſt vnder foote, doth he not right well ſhewe him ſelfe to be a very ſenſuall and fleſhly man? Yes ſurely, hee is no better then a brute beaſte. And therefore for this cauſe let vs learne, after the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Dauid to be chiefly grieued and vexed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſhall ſee the commaundements of God to be broken. It is the common and ordinarie faſhion amongeſt vs, too bee extreemly vexed when as any iniurie is done vnto vs, as if the honour or credit of any of vs be touched, we are by and by in a great heate, and deſire nothing els but too followe the matter hoatly. And why ſo? bicauſe we haue no regarde but to our owne perſon. If one man ſhall robbe another, his choler or anger will not be apeaſed: hee looketh to his purſe, his medowes, his poſſeſsions, and to his houſes, euen as he ſhalbe hindered either in this thing or in that. Now, a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7694:177"/>man that can well rule his affections ſhall neuer haue ſo great regard to his honour, nor to his goodes as hee ſhall haue when as hee ſhall ſee the righteouſnes of God to bee violated. What? (ſhall hee ſaye, euen groning in him ſelfe) ought men in this ſort to peruert the righteouſnes of God? ſhall men breake and corrupt all order and equitie? Loe, ſay I, what it is that ought to touch vs, and to make vs very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: that is, when we ſee offences committed againſt God, and not that which toucheth our owne perſons. But what ſhall we ſpeake of this: for very fewe there are which haue any care hereof. And yet for all that it is not in vaine that Dauid hath ſet downe vnto vs this example: but to ſhewe how the children of God ought to moderate their paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: that is, they ſhould alwaies beginne at this end, to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ſorrowfull to ſee the tranſgreſſors, which breake, contemne, and treade vnder foote the worde of God, and this ſhould bee their chief grief and ſorrowe which ſhould crucifie them, and not to haue ſuch regarde to their owne perſons as they haue, but to let God alwayes to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before them ſelues, and to let him to haue the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne degree, as he is moſt worthy. Now if it grieueth vs to ſee the tranſgreſſors, which teare in pieces, and breake al iuſtice and pollicy, it is certaine, that we ſhould alſo be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the euil which we know to be in our ſelues. For euery man is to iudge of him ſelfe without exception. As for thoſe which will ſay, Oh ſee, I am not grieued as touching mine own perſon: and in very deede, I care not ſo much for my ſelfe, as I am grieued to ſee men thus horribly to offend the maieſtie of God, and yet they themſelues will take leaue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit as great or els greater villanies &amp; wickednes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt: and yet when they haue thus ſaid, they will couer their own vices, &amp; flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues when they haue offended his maieſtie, wheras they ſhould lay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wide ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: now in deede theſe men ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to be right hypocrites. And why ſo I beſeech you? bicauſe they are not grieued at the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, when as they ſee the glorie of God impaired, his ſeruice not obſerued and his righteouſneſſe contemned:
<pb facs="tcp:7694:178"/>But rather perſecute the perſons, and hate not the vices which are nouriſhed, and purpoſely mainteined in them. For what ſhewe ſoeuer they make of condemning the euil, yet it may bee eaſely ſeene that they are no whit touched therewith. And by this they right well ſhewe, that they know not what it is to be grieued as they ought. Now this is not to do as wee ought: For whatſoeuer ſhewe wee ſhall make of the great zeale wee haue to the honour and glorie of God, we ſhall very well ſee, that there is nothing but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and diſsimulation in vs, if wee looke indifferently into the matter. Loe here what we haue to note out of this place. Now Dauid ſaieth in the ende.</p>
            <q>Conſider, O Lord, how I loue thy commaundementes: quicken me according vnto thy louing kindneſſe.</q>
            <p>Here Dauid doth nothing els but ſetteth downe more manifeſtly that which was ſpoken of heretofore, Conſider O Lorde, I loue thy commaundementes, hee ſpeaketh not onely of that which is ſaid vnto vs, that wee muſt loue our neighbour, liue chaſtely, honour our father and mother, do wrong to none: but vnder theſe wordes, hee comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the doctrine, wherewith God meaneth to gouerne his people, and church, as we haue already handled. Nowe in this doctrine, are conteined the promiſes, which witneſſe vnto vs his goodneſſe: yea and they haue the chiefeſt place, bicauſe that God ſhewing himſelfe vnto vs to bee our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wil not giue vs ouer for any thing: forſomuch as we be aſſured of our eternall ſaluation, and that in this worlde he hath care ouer vs, and our life is as it were committed vnto him, ſo that herein lieth the whole ſubſtance, that after hee hath pardoned vs of our ſinnes, hee alloweth vs for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and will alſo gouerne vs with his holy ſpirite. See then what it is, that is conteined in the teſtimonies of God. And ſo Dauid in ſumme, proteſteth in this verſe, that he alwaies walked in this loue of God which hee founde in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. This is it which he proteſteth, and thereupon ſayeth, <hi>Quicken me according vnto thy mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:7694:178"/>
            <p>If Dauid then loued the commaundement of God and his teſtimonies, wherefore deſireth he not to be quicke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed according to his merites? And if it be ſo that he hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, why hath he recourſe to the mercie of God? Nowe he very well ſheweth, that he meant not too boaſte of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues neither yet of any ſuch, I know not what perfection, to haue fulfilled the lawe of God: but he had a ſpeciall regard, as I haue already ſaide, to the content of God his promiſes. He alledgeth not here that he had deſerued to bee holpen: but he deſired to bee defended according to the mercie of God. In this point he ſetteth before vs his example, to the ende wee might followe him, as this is alſo the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, when as he ſpake by the mouth of Dauid. Now he goeth on for a concluſion and ſaieth,</p>
            <q>Thy word is true from euerlaſting and all the iudgementes of thy righteouſnes endure for euermore.</q>
            <p>That is to ſay, thy iuſt iudgementes are euerlaſting: or els, thy iudgementes are alwayes righteous. Heere Dauid, in ſumme, meaneth to ſignifie, that hee ſo ſtayed him ſelfe vpon the worde of God, as that he had ſet his heart vppon it, yelded him ſelfe wholy vnto it, and beſtowed all his thoughtes &amp; wittes on it. And why did he ſo? ſayth he, <hi>The beginning of it is true, and the righteouſneſſe thereof endureth for euermore.</hi> As if he ſhould haue thus ſaid, Thou, O Lord, art true in thy word, &amp; ſhalt alwayes bee found ſo, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, It is nothing but righteous, it is true from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; thy righteouſnes ſhall endure vnto thend, and with out end. See how the two borders or limittes of the worde of God are layde out. When as we ſhall ſeeke for this word, wee muſt make a deſtinction and difference, betweene truthe, and righteouſnes, with this reſolution, ſee how God ſheweth him ſelf true and righteous. And the farther we go on, the better ſhall we finde his worde to bee ſuch: ſo that after we haue throughly vnripped and examined it, we ſhall not haue one ſyllable, where righteouſnes, &amp; truth, wil not ſhewe them ſelues. Euen ſo may wee alwayes attribute this title to the woorde of God, as Dauid here ſheweth vs. In
<pb facs="tcp:7694:179"/>ſumme, when as wee would haue a perfect aſſurance, to be confirmed, and ſtrengthened in all temptations, ſo that the deuill ſhall neuer be able to take faſt holde vppon vs: let vs haue this regard, to ſtay our ſelues chiefly vpon the worde of God, and therewith to arme vs, attributing thereto theſe true titles which are here ſet downe, that there is nothing in it but all truthe and righteouſneſſe. And therefore this ought greatly to content vs, to aſſure our ſelues of God, not doubting but that hee will graunt vs the grace, that when he hath once brought vs into the waye of ſaluation, that he will continually conduct and gouerne vs, and hold vs with a mightie ſtrong arme, vntill ſuch time as hee hath brought vs to that ende whereunto he hath called vs.</p>
            <p>According too this holy doctrine, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our offences, beſeeching him that it would pleaſe him to make vs better to feele our miſeries then wee haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore felt them, to the ende we may laye our ſelues open vnto him And that we may in the meane while attaine too that remedy, as to craue pardon of him for them: not dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but that he will graunt vs pardon for them according to our deſire, through the death and paſsion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, albeit we are miſerable ſinners: And alſo that he wil through his holy ſpirite ſo purge vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſinnes, as that we deſire nothing els but to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed vnto his righteouſneſſe, to come vnto him, &amp; to aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vs thereunto daily more and more, vntill ſuch time as he hath coupled vs vnto that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life, whereunto he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exhorteth vs. That hee will not only graunt vnto vs this grace, but alſo vnto all people &amp; nations of the earth, &amp;c.</p>

The one is, that it wil ſeme that God hath not compaſsion of vs, to helpe vs. The other, that wee will bee more afearde of men then in deede wee ought:
<pb facs="tcp:7694:180"/>For we imagine that all is in their hand, and that they may doe all thinges at their owne pleaſure and as them ſelues liſte, doe God what he can to the contrary. Lo heere, I ſay what it is that he hindereth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſeuering in the feare of God: That is, That when men trouble vs with iniuries, violences, &amp; extortions, we are ſtraightwayes diſcouraged. And ſo we are heere throughly too conſider of this place where Dauid ſaith that hee ſtoode in awe of the woorde of God, although princes perſecuted him without a cauſe: &amp; in deede, wee ought euen then moſt ſpecially too weygh it, when as we fee the mightineſſe of men to aſtoniſh vs, &amp; our enemies to be in great credit and authoritie, yea that it ſeeme we are euen as ſheepe in the iawes of woulfes, that we haue no meane too reſiſt their violence, but that they may do whatſoeuer ſeemeth, good-vnto them, in ſo much that no man dareth once to open his mouth againſt them. When as, I ſay, our enemies ſhall haue all this, and bee thus highly lifted vp ouer vs, that wee knowe not what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of vs: then it is a harde matter for vs too conceiue, what the helpe which God hath promiſed vs is worth, ſo that we are ouertaken with this feare, to ſay, O ſee wee are vtterly vndone, all our cauſe is cleane caſt to the grounde. And yet in the meane while we neuer once thinke, that they are but Gnattes, or els when wee ſhall eſteeme moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they are but Frogges leaping and ſkipping vp and downe heere belowe. Neither yet haue they ſo mighty thighes and legges as that they are able too iuſtle againſt God: but that whenſoeuer he ſhall ſtretche forth his hand, it ſhall throwe downe euen into the depth, whatſoeuer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall of purpoſe with all their complices, or aftely or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly deuiſe, and whatſoeuer power they ſhall be any waye able to make. See then what wee haue here eſpecially too note: that is, that whenſoeuer we ſhall fall into the handes of our enemies, and that it ſhall ſeeme they might at their pleaſure bring to paſſe whatſoeuer they liſted, ſo that there remained no way to withſtande them: yet let vs looke vnto this infinite power of God, and not too doubt, but that

            <p>I cannot deny, but that wee ſhall haue a greate number of enemyes, and Satan will labour by all meanes poſſible to hurt vs: we ſhall haue great ſtore of his ſupporters to goe a bout to caſt vs downe headlong into the bottomleſſe pit: and yet all they ſhall doe nothing, when as wee ſhall bee in the ſafekeeping of our God. Nowe this is the ſumme, which we are too gather heereby, in the firſte place of this text. But yet we muſt goe on a great deale farther. For Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid doth not onely ſhew vnto vs, that we ought highly too eſteeme of this mightie power, and greate goodneſſe of God, wherewith he hath promiſed to helpe vs in our nede: but alſo aduertiſeth and exhorteth vs not too turne aſide from his obedience, for any hurte that men can doe vntoo vs. Nowe it is very true, that the one hangeth vppon the other. For how can it be that wee ſhould haue heartes too ſerue GOD, when as wee ſee the whole worlde too bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, and we alwayes in daunger to be hurt: That is to ſay, Let vs pot our truſt in God, although the allarme and aſſaultes bee giuen vs on euery ſide: For otherwiſe it
<pb facs="tcp:7694:181"/>ſhalbe impoſſible for vs too ſtande ſtoutly to it, without we be throughly perſwaded, that God is ſufficient to defende vs: yea when as we ſee all the men in the world, to ſet them ſelues againſt vs: but that we truſting in his power, ceaſe not to followe that which he hath commaunded vs: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the lets that men can poſſibly lay before vs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, we muſt giue our minds to this word of God, as here it is ſaid, <hi>I ſtand in awe of thy word,</hi> For Dauid meaneth not that he would haue God to ſhew himſelfe in a viſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he might come vnto him to doe him homage: but he is contented that God hath ſhewed vnto him his will &amp; pleaſure, and holdeth him ſelfe well pleaſed therewith. And euen ſo muſt wee alſo doe. For there are a great many of people, which wil brag that they feare God, and profeſſe it with open mouth. And yet notwithſtanding, ſee how God calleth vs vnto him by his word, &amp; we for al that are no whit moued therwith: yea we ſcarcely vouchſafe once too open our mouthes to declare that we are contented to obay him. Where then is that feare wherof we ſo brag, ſince the word, wherin the maieſtie of God appeareth, is ſo contemned of vs? See then wherefore we ought a great deale the more to conſider of this manner of ſpeaking which Dauid heere v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that he ſtandeth in awe of the woord of God, and that he deſired none other viſible preſence: but it ſuffiſed him that God had onely ſpoken, and hee made good accounte thereof. Now, if we doe not thus, we ſhall euer be letted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> following that which God hath commaunded vs, neither ſhall we euer haue the harts, to diſcharge our ſelues perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our dueties. Contrariwiſe, they that ſhalbe reſolued as Dauid was, only to giue their mindes to the word of God, ſhall ouercome all lets &amp; ſtops: Moreouer after they haue walked aright, doe they ſee that men murmure againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for it, that it ſeemeth that they for their wel dooing ſhalbe reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſed with euill, and that this thing &amp; that is miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought againſt them? that they muſte needes lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in long attending without ſpating, yea that they haue kindled the fury of men againſt them, without any
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7694:181"/>occaſion giuen by them? doe they ſee, I ſay, all this? And if they doe thus, it is very well: for then ſtande they in awe of the word of God, knowing that they ſhall not be without the help of God, as alſo our ſauiour Chriſte exhorteth vs. <hi>Feare not</hi> ſaith he <hi>them which may kill the body:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28.</note> 
               <hi>but I wil ſhewe you whome you ought to feare,</hi> to wit: <hi>feare him who hath both ſoule and body in his ſubiection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as then you ſhall looke vnto your God, then ſhall you not neede to feare whatſoeuer men goe about to cauſe you to turne aſide, &amp; to withdraw you from the right way. And thus we ſee in ſumme, that it is our infirmitie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our infidelitie which hindereth vs, when as men threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs, when as we ſee the wicked practizes which are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined againſt vs, and that wee are troubled and tormented without cauſe. For if wee ſtill looked vnto God, this ſhould neuer be able to withdrawe vs, but that wee ſhould alwayes remaine conſtant to doe that which hee commaundeth vs. And by this alſo we may ſee, how al to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary raigneth at this day in the world, and that there is very little feare of the word of God. For ſo that wee can holde the fauour of men, in doing our duetie any way: wel, this goeth for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But if there bloweth an ill winde, and that wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any euill practiſe, or that we bee threatened, and that the vngodly beare the ſway: we are incontinent aſtonyed, yea and that in ſuch a feare, as that we are not able once to ſtirr a finger. And that which is more, to gratifie the wicked whom we ſee to be in authoritie, we will make no bones at it, as we ſay, to offend the maieſtie of God. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence commeth this? but that we loke not vnto his word, as here it is ſet downe? We are then euen conuinced of infidelitie when as we aſſure not our ſelues of the helpe of our God, to do that which he hath ordayned, and that which is our duty to doe: that we haue not this inuincible power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the aſſaultes of men. And why ſo? Becauſe it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that we haue not earneſtly ſtoode in awe of the word of God, which ought to be as an aſſured fortreſſe, and not to make any account of whatſoeuer that Satan can any way craftely inuent againſt vs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:182"/>
            <p>Now after that Dauid hath thus ſpoken, hee goeth on and ſayth,</p>
            <q>I am as glad of thy worde, as one that findeth great ſpoyles.</q>
            <p>That is to ſay, he gladded more in the promiſes of God, then in all the riches in the worlde, as wee haue ſeene in the nienth parte, beginning with the letter TETH, which hath beene in that place ſong, That hee eſteemed more of the worde of God, then of all the golde &amp; Siluer in the worlde. And heere he ſayth, that he reioyceth to heare God ſpeake, more then if hee had ſounde all the goods in the worlde, that all the riches in the worlde were nothing to him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it, It ſeemeth greatly at the firſt ſight that heere is ſome contrarietie, as to ſtand in feare &amp; awe of the word of God, &amp; alſo to reioyce in it. For ioy &amp; feare are meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traryes. But we haue already declared what it is that Dauid meaneth by this feare: not that hee was abaſhed too ſerue God, ne yet that he douted of his ſaluation: But it was to bridle him and to holde him in obedience, and alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that God gaue him ſuch a conſtancy againſt all the men in the worlde, as that when hee ſeeth all the creatures of God to lifte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vp againſt him, yet that hee ceaſed not to goe on to doe that which God had committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and that which he ſaw was his duetie to doe. To be ſhort, let vs then holde this for a reſolute point, that Dauid had not ſuch a feare as made him fierce and cruell, ne yet which made him to flye from the preſence of God: but he ſo reuerenced that, which God ſpake, as that hee ſtoode boldly at defyaunce with all men, declaring that hee made no reckoning of their fury, poyſon, nor yet of all their deadly enmities. Dauid, I ſay, cared for none of all this, And why ſo? Becauſe he ſo reuerenced and honoured God, as that he fully repoſed him ſelfe vpon his worde.</p>
            <p>Nowe, when as we haue ſuch a feare, it is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ioy which Dauid heere ſpeaketh off: But it is rather an excellent accorde, or ſweete hermony: for it is impoſſible for vs rightly to giue our ſelues vnto God, and to obay him in ſuch ſort as we ought without we loue him,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7694:182"/>and that his word be pleaſaunt and ſweete vnto vs. And ſee wherefore Dauid doth not onely ſay, that the woorde of God was more deere vnto him, then either golde or ſiluer: but he ſayth, that it was ſweeter vnto him then hony. Hee ſetteth downe theſe two thinges which ought too be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together: to wit, that the word of God ought too be more deere and ſweete vnto vs, then all other thinges, and that we ought to take all our delight and pleaſure therein, deſiring nothing elſe, but to order and holde our ſelues to it: knowing that whatſoeuer God hath, is to this ende, too communicate the ſame vnto vs, that wee might taſte of his bountie and loue.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee ſee that Dauid did not without cauſe ioyne this ioy: which he conceiued of the woorde of God, with feare: ſignifiing that he ſtoode not in awe of God perforce, and with a ſlauiſh feare, as we ſay: but he did it in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him too be his God and Sauiour, and ſetling him ſelfe wholly vpon his promiſes. And thus much for this ſecond verſe. Nowe he addeth ſoone after:</p>
            <q>I hate falſhod and abhorre it: but thy lawe doe I loue.</q>
            <p>This verſe is not heere added but to good purpoſe: For Dauid ſheweth that we can neuer be glad (as hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how he hath beene) neither yet ſtand in awe of the word of God, without we deteſt falſhod. Now, we of our owne nature are ſo nuſſeled in vanitie, as that it is lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The lawe of God then ſhall neuer come ſo fully home vnto vs, as that we may iuſtly ſay, that we earneſtly heare it, and receiue it from the hart, vntil ſuch time as we haue ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt our fleſhly affections, that is too ſay, againſt all whatſoeuer is in our nature, becauſe it is all but vanitie. In ſumme, Dauid, after hee had ſpoken of this ioy, which hee had conceiued of the promiſes of God, wherein hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto vs his goodneſſe: after he had ſpoken of the feare which we owe him, to become ſubiect vnto him, and after that he had giuen him the authoritie which hee deſerued aboue all other men and creatures: for a concluſion hee addeth, the meane howe to attaine to all this: to wit, that
<pb facs="tcp:7694:183"/>we muſt eſchewe falſhod, and not onely eſchew, &amp; hate it, but alſo deteſt it: yea, ſignifying that wee muſt greatly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it, ſo that wee ouercome all our wicked deſires and tame them, and all other our luſtes which cary vs away too wickedneſſe, &amp; withdraw vs from the obedience of God. So then, we ſee nowe, that naturall men can neuer be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſerue God, vntil ſuch time as they haue ſtriue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the vanitie of their owne nature, and that not onely once, or twiſe, but alſo too continue it all the dayes of their life. For what are the luſtes which are in vs, and which doe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly leade vs from the right way? In very deede, the more parte are ſo preuented with them, as that they feele them not: or elſe thinke, that it is nothing ſo meruelous thicke darkeneſſe remaineth in them. As for thoſe which haue a deſire with all their hart to forſake them, yet ſhall we finde them alſo to be ouermuch nuſſeled in them. Moreouer, if all the men in the worlde were examined, and an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, I confeſſe that wee ſhall finde the moſte wicked ſometimes to be remorſed and ſtoong, and to be inwardly pricked and conſtrayned manger their hearts to haue loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe euill. They haue an eye vnto it by fittes: and yet they ceaſe not too follows the euill with a continuall courſe, although betweene whiles they haue a lothing of it. And we muſt not greatly meruell at this: For carnall men which are not gouerned by the ſpirit of God, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with their wicked affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as with a fury, ſo that their whole reaſon is altogither brutiſh. And euen they ſhal very wel haue an hatred of their euill, but yet not ſo flye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, as that wee ſhall not be able to ſay, that they haue ſuch a feare of God as is to be required, too forſake them ſelues, and wholy to ſubmit themſelues vnto his will.</p>
            <p>Se heere what we haue to conſider out of this place. But in the meane while one thing is to be obſerued, that Dauid maketh a compariſon betweene the lawe of God, and all whatſoeuer that men can imagine on their owne head, with all their reaſons and deſires: as if he ſhould haue ſaid,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7694:183"/>That there is but onely rule that is good, and worthy to be beloued, to wit, the lawe of God. When then our life ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be conformable to the word of God, all ſhall goe wel: But wee ſhall not withdrawe our ſelues neuer ſo little from it: as that we ſhal not by and by royle ouerthwart al the fields. And why ſo? For all our trueth and ſinceritie is incloſed within this rule which God hath ſet downe vnto vs. Wee ought then to beare this honor vnto the word of God, too heare it as it is layde out vnto vs, and to follow it in all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie: or elſe ſo ſoone as we ſhall decline from it neuer ſo little, ſee, we are quite out of the way of ſaluation, ſo that we cannot choſe but to be confounded, vntill ſuch time as we are entred againe into the way, which God hath ſhewed vs. Now hee addeth:</p>
            <q>Seuen times a day doe I prayſe thee: becauſe of thy righteous iudgements.</q>
            <p>Heere we may take this word <hi>Iudgement,</hi> for the manner which God holdeth in gouerning the worlde, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which he layeth vpon the vngodly: as alſo for the grace which he cauſeth them to feele which call vppon him, and which walke ſincerely before him. For the holy Scripture oftentimes when it ſpeaketh of the Iudgementes of God, meaneth al this. But becauſe that in this Pſalme, the Iudgements, are for the moſt parte taken for the ſtatutes, &amp; ordinaunces that are contayned in the law of God: I glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meane too handle it at this preſent thus: that is, That Dauid prayſed GOD, becauſe he had giuen vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a lawe which was bothe iuſte and full of equitie, and that therein hee had whereof to bee glad, and to prayſe and magnifie him.</p>
            <p>Loe heere a place well woorthy the noting. For by theſe woordes Dauid doth vs too witte, that wee cannot prayſe GOD, ſo longe as wee are not inſtructed in his woorde, our mouthe ſhall bee cloſed vppe, and our hearte looked faſt vppe, ſo that a man ſhall not pull from vs one good woorde, which may turne too the prayſe of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:184"/>
            <p>And to proue this to be ſo, we ſee that the vnfaithful ſhal not onely bee dumbe too praiſe God: But they will alſo fall out with him, that whatſoeuer ſhall come from their mouthes, ſhalbe to blaſpheme God, &amp; to murmur againſt his diuine maieſtie. As for the ignoraunt, they ſhalbe ſo blockiſh as that they ſhall haue no deſire to prayſe God: &amp; if they doe prayſe him, it ſhall bee but for faſhions ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is but a mocking of God and his word. How then may we praiſe God in good earneſt &amp; without hypocriſie? Forſooth. euen when as wee ſhall be inſtructed in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, when as we ſhall haue knowen what care he hath of our ſaluation, how he gouerneth his Church, howe hee embaceth him ſelfe, to apply him ſelf vnto our groſſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, &amp; to make himſelf to be familiarly acquainted with vs. When then we ſhal ſee God to haue ſuch a care ouer vs to inſtruct vs, that he hath ſo rightly ruled our life, that hee ſo purueieth for al our neceſſities as that we want nothing: ought not we to giue our mindes vnto him, yea euen to be inflamed wholly to magnifie his holy name, and to bee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed with that deſire which Dauid heere ſpeaketh of.</p>
            <p>Let vs now ſee what we haue to gather in ſumme out of this place: and thereby we may ſee how ſlenderly wee haue at this day profited in the Schoole of God. For, whence commeth this circumſpection? Where is that zeale of ours in praiſing of God, which Dauid ſayth, that he had? Seeing that ſarcely one word can bee pulled from vs, when any ſpeech ſhalbe of prayſing God, yea, were it not for faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake and contenaunce onely. This is farre from continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, and farre from extending our whole ſtudy thereto, as to make it the moſt principall thing that ought to bee in our whole life. Now we are heereby conuinced of our ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtudving and meditating in the worde of God becauſe we are ſo colde and negligent in prayſing of him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauing a greater care in acknowledging his benefites beſtowed vpon vs. And that which is more, Let vs through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider that Dauid ſayeth not onely, that he was ſtirred vp to prayer vnto God for once, &amp; ſo continued it for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7694:184"/>dayes, but hee ſayth <hi>dayly,</hi> &amp; afer, <hi>ſeuen times:</hi> that is, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in it all his life long. For this word <hi>Seuen,</hi> is taken in the holy Scripture for a meruelous perſeuerance, when as men continue it, and are not drawne away for any cauſe whatſoeuer, but do alwayes holde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues therto. And this is the meaning of the Scripture, for this number of Seuen. Nowe Dauid proteſting that hee dayly prayſed God ſeuen times, meaneth that he exerciſed him ſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, from the morning vnto the euening. And after that, hee exhorteth all other men too haue the like deſire and zeale too praiſe God. So then, let vs compare our ſelues with Dauid, and we ſhall finde, that wee haue learned very little out of the word of God, conſidering that we are ſo ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in prayſing of him. And yet for all that wee are greatly too giue him, yea infinite thanks, when as wee ſhall haue knowne his grace and goodneſſe towards vs, in that hee is ſo carefull to gouerne and order our life, and too ſhewe vs the way of ſaluation. The Papiſtes haue applyed this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſet houres: and haue layde holde onely on the firſt parte of the verſe, ſaying, That they prayſe God ſeuen times a day, when as they ſing their Mattaines, Primes, their third houre, ſixth houre, at midnight, their euenſong and Compline. See heere how God ſhall be well prayſed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times a day as they thinke. Yea, yea, good inough, As though God would call back that, which hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by his prophet Iſaiah, <hi>This people,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>honor me with their lips, but their hearts are very farre from me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 29.23.</note> He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on farther and ſayth, that hee will ſhewe them that hee cannot abide ſuch mockeryes, and to be ſo dallyed withall. See heere howe God threateneth the Iewes with an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vengeaunce, becauſe they onely prayſed him with the mouth. Nowe, we knowe, what their ſet houres which their Monkes, Fryers, and Prieſtes doe ſing, or rather which they bleate and houle out in their Churches, are that they are without either vnderſtanding, deuotion, and any good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire whatſoeuer. And they thinke it not inough that they
<pb facs="tcp:7694:185"/>ſhewe them ſelues in deede openly to mock God: but their deuiliſh doctrine alſo emporteth the ſame, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but merit, hauing this finall meaning to prayſe God. So that when a Chanon hath put on his Grayamiſſe, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſſe, and going out of his Chamber with this finall intent: and yet anon after thinketh of his Goſſip, his cheere, and his paſtime: yea that he play the Hypocrite there, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth he muſt needes merit. It is very true, that they will confeſſe, that there is veniall ſinne entermedled amongeſt: but yet that the ſame cannot hinder them from meriting, when as they had this finall intent to prayſe God: yea and ſo alſo, as that when they come home againe vntoo their houſe, they think them ſelues to haue diſcharged their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. To be ſhort, ſo that at the beginning and the end, they had ſome motion to deuotion, it is inough. And is not this wholly to mock God, and to dally with him, more then a man would dandle a young Childe. But ſee how this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable curſed people haue peruerted all the holy Scripture, in mingling it with ſo ſhameful thinges that euen the very Heathen, when as they ſhall haue gotten the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the leaſt ſparke of trueth, will bee aſhamed too ſee ſuch ſeruice in the Papacy too bee called godly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. When it is all after this manner, I pray you what prayſing of GOD ſhall there remains? Let vs then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, that theſe people are very farre from Dauid: and that if wee woulde take example by them, they right well ſhewe, that they knowe not what it is too prayſe God, but rather prophane his holy name, when as they wil thruſt in ſuch abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s amongſt, as we dayly ſee them to commit againſt his worde. Now Dauid addeth ſoone after:</p>
            <q>They which loue thy law, ſhall haue great proſperitie, and they ſhall haue no hurt.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid beeing led by the ſpirit of God, as a true Prophet, contenteth not him ſelfe with ſpeaking of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7694:185"/>which hee had receiued, But inſtructeth others of that, which they haue to doe. Although in trueth, all the proteſtations which wee haue ſeene heere, are full of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. And that it is ſo, wee ſee that Dauid might very well haue prayſed God in his hart, without declaring what he had done: But it was needefull that he might be ſet as a Glaſſe before our eyes, to the ende we might be ledde too followe him. But yet in this verſe, he more expreſſely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth foorth the office and duetie of a prophet, when as hee ſayth, They which loue thy lawe, ſhall haue great proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and they ſhall haue no hurt.</p>
            <p>Nowe by this he ſheweth vnto vs that wee are euen in good earneſt accurſed, when as wee giue our ſelues vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our owne fleſhly liking, becauſe we would bee eſteemed amongſt men, and take pleaſure in our paſtimes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes. And why ſo? Becauſe we ſhall be alwayes tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with vnquietneſſe and griefe, ſo that we ſhall neuer be at peace and reſt. And although wee veryly thinke our ſelues to be aſſured of victory all the dayes of our life, yet ſhall we reele this way and that, and willingly hurt our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, ſo that it ſhoulde ſeeme we had a will too breake both our armes and legges, &amp; in the end, neck and all. And the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, for that we follow not the way which God hath ſet before vs. Let vs then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, what the meaning of Dauid is, to wit, that we muſt not make reckoning of any aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce heere in this worlde, except we loue the woorde of God: yea and that ſo to, as that we deſire nothing elſe, but to be wholly ordered by it, to ſubmit and holde our ſelues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, without beeing withdrawen by the intiſementes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and with all the temptations of our corrupte fleſhe and nature ſhall laye before our eyes. In very deede it may very well ſeeme at the firſte ſight, that experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs the contrary of that which Dauid ſpeaketh. For who are moſte greeued, vexed, and troubled? Forſooth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the children of God, who haue al the ſhame &amp; offences doone vnto them? Euen the ſelfe ſame men. For it is ſaide,
<pb facs="tcp:7694:186"/>That our ſauiour Chriſt is as it were a badge and marke of all theſe contrarieties, we muſt then haue all the vngodly to be our enemyes. In ſumme, all they which intend too ſerue God, cannot eſcape from ſhame and ſlaunderous reportes, from beeing deſpiſed, troubled, and outraged, &amp; to indure great numbers of iniuryes and violences: Loe howe the Children of God are intreated and handled in this preſent life. And ſo by this reaſon, it ſeemeth that Dauid promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs heere, that which we haue not. But we are heere too conſider, that Dauid promiſeth vs not ſuch a reſt, as ſhalbe as it were an earthly Paradiſe. Hee ſpeaketh of this true proſperitie, which the Children of God haue, when they are contented to ſerue him: that in all their griefes: yea in all their anguiſhes and troubles, they runne onely vntoo him, and lay all their cares vpon him, not doubting but that he will helpe them: and afterward, heerevpon not too feare, whatſoeuer that mortall men can imagine or deuiſe againſt them.</p>
            <p>When as then wee ſhall haue ſuch a peace as this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our eſtate and condition be in the viewe of men the moſte miſerable in the whole worlde, yet ought we too bee throughly contented, knowing that God will raiſe vs vp, and make vs to tryumph ouer all our enemyes, although we thought we ſhould fall euen to bee cruſſhed and vtterly beaten too poulder, yet will God bee ready too vpholde vs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſam.</hi> 91.</note> and make vs to be bleſſed. As it is ſaid in the 91. Pſalme. That God will not ſuffer his faithfull too tumble ouer and ouer, neither yet ſo to fall as that they ſhall not be able to releeue them ſelues againe: but will rather ſende his Angels to lifte them vpp into the Ayre. In very deede, yet ſhall it not bee ſo, as that we ſhall not ſometimes hurt our ſelues: howbeit the aſſaultes ſhall not be ſuch as to fruſh vs dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: howe euer it bee wee ſhall in the ende feele in what ſort God ſhall haue aſſiſted vs by his Angels. This is the meane and the manner too feele by effecte, that which Dauid ſpeaketh off.</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:7694:186"/>
            <p>Now in trueth, the wicked ſhal neuer be able to take any ſuch holde: becauſe they are not worthy of it. For by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they know not what God, nor his worde is, without it be to hate him, and too anger him: it is meete that they proue by experiment the contrary of that which is heere ſpoken of by Dauid: to wit, becauſe they loue not the lawe of God, it is good reaſon that they ſhoulde bee inwardly troubled, and greeuouſly tormented without end. Now it followeth,</p>
            <q>Lorde I haue truſted in thy ſauing health: and haue done thy commaundements.</q>
            <p>Heere Dauid more liuely expreſſeth and declareth that which I haue already touched: to wit, that our affection in ſeruing of God, proceedeth of the truſt which wee haue in him, in beleeuing his promiſes, If then we conceiue not that God is our ſauiour, and ſo by that meanes truſte that hee will help vs, it is impoſſible that we ſhould be inflamed too ſerue him. It is true, we may very well haue ſome feeling of the duetie which we owe vnto him, and be ſome what tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched therewith, although in deed few there are which think therof: but admit it be ſo, yet will no man for all that freely and of his owne accord, ſay, O come, Let vs ſerue, yea let vs ſerue our God, euen vntill ſuch time as we are fully aſſured of the good which he meaneth, and is ready to procure vs, and of the true and full hope of our ſaluation, throughly imprinted in our heartes. And ſo let vs rightly conſider, that they which remember no more of that which is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto them but this, to ſay, Loe this is it which GOD commaundeth vs: we muſt either doe this or that: Truely this is no pointe of true Chriſtianitie. And why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the principalleſt pointe of Chriſtianitie, is to knowe the goodneſſe of God, and the mercie which hee vſeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs.</p>
            <p>Loe, this is I ſay, the true knowledge which wee muſte learne in the Schoole of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and holde vs to that which he hath declared vnto vs. And beſides, we are alſo to conſider of that which he commaundeth vs: but
<pb facs="tcp:7694:187"/>his promiſes muſt be preferred, &amp; haue the cheefeſt place. And by this alſo we are ſhewed, that in the popiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the principall doctrine of Chriſtianitie is put out &amp; made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Becauſe that when the Papiſtes creake and chatter their prayers, making as though they preſented their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications vnto God, they ſay, that they muſt neuer aſſure them ſelues of that which they pray for. And the cauſe is, for that they looke not vnto the free promiſes of God. And how ſo? Beholde an hypocrite ſhall ſtep vp and preach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that which euery man is bounde to doe. Hee will preach vnto you of Chaſtitie, he will make you another Sermon of Almes, one of this matter, another of that: and yet for all this, we knowe not what it is to beleeue in God. Then doe we a great deale leſſe know what it is to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in full aſſurance, to ſay, God is our father, he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs for his children, becauſe he hath vs as he would wiſh, &amp; that our ſins are forgiuen vs through the grace of our lord Ieſus Chriſt. There is no whit of this in popery: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is impoſſible that there ſhould be one word of good and ſound doctrine in it, and profitable vnto ſaluation. Let vs then well conſider of this ſaying of Dauid, O Lorde, I haue truſted in thy ſauing health, and haue doone thy Commaundements. Nowe in the ende he ſayth:</p>
            <q>
               <l>My ſoule hath kept thy teſtimonyes: and I loue them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</l>
               <l>I haue kept thy commaundements and teſtimonies: for all my wayes are before thee.</l>
            </q>
            <p>After that Dauid hath ſufficiently proteſted, that hee loueth the word of God, that it was ſo ſweete and pleaſant vnto him, as that all his ſtudy and delight conſiſted therin: he concludeth and ſaith, That his ſoule had kept it, as if he ſhould haue ſaid, O Lord, in that I was giuen to ſerue thee, it was not with my hands and feete onely, but becauſe I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thy word, yea and that with all my ſoule, and I take my whole delight therein. For when the Hebrewes meane too ſhewe a pure and ſounde lyking, they ſay, My ſoule hath done this, or that, that is aſmuch to ſay, as I haue doone
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7694:187"/>it with all mine hearte. Loe then an heartie ſeruice which Dauid heere expreſſeth: &amp; this is yet a point which ought throughly too be conſidered of: For wee ſee howe men are giuen to play the hypocrites: euen too ſet a very fayre outwarde ſhewe of the matter, and by that meanes thinke them ſelues to be diſcharged before God.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee muſt beginne farder of, as Dauid heere ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, that is, wee muſte keepe the woorde of God in our heartes. Wherein hee confirmeth the matter, which we haue already heeretofore handled: to witte, that the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, to haue GOD ſimply to teach vs, whereby wee might know what he requireth at our hands, &amp; what our duetie is towards him: but he buildeth vpon his promiſes. Howbeit Dauid hauing ſaid, that his ſoul kept the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, becauſe he loued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by this which he addeth ſone after he ioyneth the promiſes with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſaying <hi>For al my wayes are before thine eyes,</hi> It is true, that he ſheweth by theſe words, that except he had byn ſure that god protected him, it had not byn poſſible for him to haue had that true lyking to haue ſerued his maieſtie. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon hangeth the ſeconde pointe, that God helde him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his preſence, becauſe hee ſhould not haue leaue to doe euill: as if hee ſhoulde haue ſaide, O Lorde, becauſe I knowe that no man is able too hide him ſelfe from thee, Loe why I giue my ſelfe wholly too feare and ſerue thee. And too ſay the trueth, what is the cauſe that the vngodly take ſuch libertie, to commit and deuiſe ſuch vilanous and greeuous Actes, as that they them ſelues are aſhamed off, yea that it maketh the very heares of their head to ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: What is the cauſe of this? The reaſon is, for that they knowe not that God ſeeth them, for if they were ſure of that, they would be ſomwhat moued with the feare of his maieſtie. So then, in that the faithles war thus againſt God, and take libertie too doe wickedly: it is, bicauſe they think that God ſeeth them not, according too that ſaying in the Scripture, <hi>The wicked man hath ſaid, God ſeeth not, hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing of that which is doone heere on the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:188"/>
            <p>I meane not that the wicked doe thus openly ſpeake: yet for all that they think no leſſe: as by experience wee ſee, for they thinke that God marketh not all their iniquities, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet that it is needefull for them once too make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their ſinnes. Howbeit Dauid ſayth cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, That becauſe hee knewe that all his wayes were before God, therefore he kept his commaundements. See alſo why the ſcripture, in ſpeaking of the holy fathers which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſinceerly, ſayth, That they walked before God: to wit, they had this conſideration, that they knew that God did ſee them: and therefore they walked, as if they had beene in his preſence. And this importeth, that they toke not ſuch liberty as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues thought good, but that they wholy ordered them ſelues according to the will of God, as hee had declared it by his worde. See then Dauid his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And euen ſo muſt we alſo doe, if wee will haue our life and conuerſation to be well ordered: to witte, to know that God ſeeth vs, and therefore that we cannot flye from his hand, but muſt ſubmit our ſelues vnto it, albeit wee wil not doe it freely and of our owne accorde. And ſo let vs willingly be contented to be, ruled by him, beeing certify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his loue and goodneſſe towards vs, to the ende wee might in trueth make this proteſtation which Dauid heere maketh.</p>
            <p>According too this holy doctrine, let vs humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good god, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our offences, beſeeching him that it woulde pleaſe him to make vs to feele the power of his woorde, in ſuch ſort, as his holy Prophet heere ſheweth vs, and ſo too feele it, as that wee may wholy ſubmitte our ſelues vnto it: Knowing that when it ſhall come in queſtion for vs too remitte our ſelues, and cleaue vnto him as hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that wee muſt forſake the whole worlde, and all our carnall affections which any way hinder vs from comming vnto him: to the ende wee may ſo climbe vp vnto his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, as that not fearing the world nor all his aſſaultes, wee may putte our whole confidence in his mercifull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7694:188"/>and boldly preſent vs before his face: to the ende the may receiue vs, ſo that wee might alwayes bee gouerned through his holy ſpirit, vntil ſuch time as he hath brought vs vnto that perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherevnto he calleth and biddeth vs. That hee will not onely graunt vntoo vs this grace, but alſo &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe eight laſt verſes, which ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che knitting vp of the whole Pſalme, do ſhew vnto vs that, which we oftentimes haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeene: to wit, that Dauid his chiefeſt deſire was this, to be duely and truely inſtructed in the word of God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed: for he tooke ſuch pleaſure in it, as that all the reſt was little, or nothing worth vnto him in reſpect of the ſame. Now it is very true, that he hath already ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſpoken of this matter: and yet that which he preſently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth is not ſupperfluous, eſpecially, if we conſider in what ſort our carnall deſires rule vs. For that is it which letteth vs that we can not onely haue that feruency which Dauid had, to ſeeke throughly to profit in the ſchoole of God: but we ſcarſely haue ſo much as any ſmall deſire. And therefore as I haue already ſaid, we are too too much nuzzeled in our earthly affections. Wherefore this is a leſſon which ought many times too put vs in minde: that if wee will pray vnto God according vnto his will, wee muſt not come vnto him with a deſire of our owne, to ſaye whatſoeuer commeth in our brayne, yea and to leaue out the moſt principall parte: but we muſt beginne with this ſaying: to wit, that it would pleaſe God ſo to inſtruct vs, as that our life may be ſquared according to his law, and we to cleaue ſo vnto it, as not to come with a double and twyfold heart. Although we are to ſtriue againſt the worlde, and our owne nature, yet muſt we remaine conſtant in this chiefly to loue the woorde of God. And therefore for this cauſe Dauid here ſayeth,</p>
            <q>Let my Complaint come before thee, O Lord: and giue me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding according vnto thy word.</q>
            <p>When he ſpeaketh of his complaint which hee maketh vnto the Lord, he ſheweth that he made no cold prayer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as we many times, and as it were daily do but with great vehemency. I can not deny but that an hypocrite
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7694:189"/>may very well make complaint with a loude noyſe, and thruſt out his weaſaunt. But Dauid hauing here conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, meaneth not to make an outward ſhew before men. Wherefore, That he cried out aloude, importeth as much as an earneſt teſtimonie wherewith hee was pricked forward. Now by this we ſee, that he chiefly deſired that which he craueth: to wit, to haue God to inſtruct him, and to giue him vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. And in deſiring this gift of God, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth that he was of him ſelfe a very wretched blind ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee neuer vnderſtoode any thing, yea although he had the lawe in his hands, which he might reade, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was conteined a true perfection of all wiſedome, yet that he ſtill continued eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like a poore miſerable blind wretch, except God enlightened him. So then, let vs vnderſtande that this is an eſpeciall gift which God beſtoweth vpon vs, when hee openeth our eyes, too make vs vnderſtande that which is ſhewed in his word, whether we reade it, or that it be preached vnto vs. Yea, and let vs not here make any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, thinking our ſelues to bee more ſharpe witted, or abler then Dauid was: but let vs rather knowe, that if hee needed to beſeech God to giue him vnderſtanding, that we for our partes haue as great neede. So then, it can not bee choſen but that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath deliuered vnto vs his word, and declared his will therein conteined: and for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance hereof inlighteneth our hearts by his holy ſpirite: for other waies we ſhal haue our cares beaten in vaine: and then the doctrine which we haue heard will do vs no good. Now that which followeth, <hi>According vnto thy worde,</hi> may two wayes beſet forth, According vnto thy word: that is to ſay, that thou wilt make me wiſe. And after what maner? That I be altogether ruled by thee, and do that which thou commaundeſt. This is a very true ſaying, for by this wee are admoniſhed to heare God ſpeake, and we againe muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to haue dominion ouer vs: and not to be ouertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with this foooliſh arrogancie, and ſaye, I haue knowledge inough, I neede not ſo much teaching. Wherefore, when as God ſhall haue ſpoken the worde, let vs paſſe it ſimply and without gaineſaying.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:190"/>
            <p>This ſentence then which I haue ſpoken is very true but yet it agreeth not with the meaning of Dauid, he yet with the plameneſſe of the text. For he craueth here two things, the one in the firſt verſe, the other in the ſecond. He ſayeth in the firſt verſe, Let my complaint come before thee, that I might be inſtructed according vnto thy worde. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde he addeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>

               </gap> my ſupplication come be fore thee: and deliuer me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto thy worde.</q>
            <p>It is very true that he vſeth two ſentences: but yet they are not without a marueilous grace in one ſelfe ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and by this repetition we may the better perceiue that Dauid meant not, but to haue God to graunt either obboth his requeſtes, according to the promiſes which he had made him. See then, what the naturall ſenſe is of the firſt verſe, O Lord, giue me vnderſtanding as thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. And this is according vnto the rule which wee haue heretofore touched, that wee ought not too craue of God any thing whatſoeuer, without it bee that which hee hath promiſed, yea ſo that we be aſſured of his wil. It is very true, that God dealeth very familiarly with vs, when as hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, to come vnto him, as the father calleth his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuffereth vs to poure abroade all our affections vnto him, and to vnburden them as it were in his lappe, as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune maketh mention and yet hee meaneth notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that wee ſhould holde this modeſtie, not too craue of him any thing whatſoeuer that ſeemeth good in our owne eyes: but to diſcerne of that which beſt liketh him. And howe ſhall wee knowe that? Forſooth by his promiſes. Wherefore we muſt be well aſſured of our prayers; and not to craue of God at a wilde aduenture, this thing, or that: but we muſt beſeeche him, and be certaine and ſure that he will heare vs. And how may this bee done, ſeeing that no man hath beene of his counſell, too ſaye that wee haue any ſuch certaintie, except hee his ſelfe had tolde vs, that it is his pleaſure to graunt vs? So then, it is requiſite that al our prayers be conformable vnto the promiſes of God, that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7694:190"/>we gather together, I ſay, out of the holy ſcripture, al what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he hath promiſed vs, to the ende wee may that waye haue an entrance to make our ſupplications, and prayers vnto him. Now it remaineth for vs to knowe, whether Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid had the promiſe alone made vnto him by God, or els, whether it bee common vnto vs all. No doubt of it God ſpake not to Dauid as to a priuate man: but too declare in generall that he would not miſſe to inſtruct all thoſe which come vnto him in humilitie, and to aſke nothing, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto his worde. Since then it is ſo, that God hath ſpoken to vs in generall, declaring that he is ready to playe the part of a ſchoolemaiſter, if we will become as his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: we may then ſay with Dauid, O Lorde, giue me vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding according to thy promiſe. Now we are here brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to marke two notes. The firſt is, that we are aduertiſed to acknowledge our ignorance and rudeneſſe. For if we craue of God to bee made wiſe, and then we thinke to become wiſe through our owne induſtrie and power, this is a meere mockerie. We muſe then acknowledge our ſelues to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided both of wit and reaſon, if wee will make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in truth: to wit, to haue God to giue vs vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. And thus much for the firſt point. For the reſt, we ought to know, that God deſireth but to receiue vs with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: to wit, euen when we ſhalbe humbled and caſt down. For otherwiſe we will neuer abide to bee inſtructed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer holy ſcripture we haue, bicauſe that in it hee ſayeth, that it is his office to teach the humble and meeke, that it is as it were his very proper nature to open the eyes of the blinde, and to inſtruct thoſe which are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to gather together the ſtrayed ſheepe, and to bring them to the hauen of ſaluation, when as they are in the way of perdition. Since then it is ſo, that God taketh all this vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe, let not vs doubt but that he will heare all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes. But what? We ſee howe colde we are. For we are ſo hindered with the things of this worlde as that wee leaue out the principal. Now after that Dauid had declared what he chiefly deſired, he goeth on and ſayeth,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:191"/>
            <q>My lippes ſhall ſpeake of thy praiſe: when thou haſt taught me thy ſtatutes.</q>
            <p>Here he proſecuteth that which he began withall at the firſt: that is, to ſhew that he would not be vnthankefull, but that he would acknowledge the benefites of God. It is very true that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come vnto God, it is not any thing nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs to make great outwarde ſhewes, as though hee knew them not perfectly inough as of him ſelfe: but thus he meaneth, that when we pray, hee would haue vs to ſaye, that we will neuer hereafter be vnthankefull vnto him: and this needed not neither but to the ende, the better to ſtirre vs vp to do our dueties. And this alſo maketh vs to praye with a boulder courage, to feele the fruite which ſhall come vnto vs, when as we ſhal haue obtained that which we haue craued and deſired. Dauid then, in ſaying here, My lippes, O Lord, ſhall ſpeake of thy prayſe, when thou haſt taught me thy ſtatutes: hee meaneth that hee ſhalbe diſpoſed to praiſe God with open mouth. Nowe why ſpeaketh Dauid after this maner? In thus doing, he taketh vppon him, and ſtirreth vp him ſelfe too ſuch an acknowledgement, as hee proteſteth to make: and it is, as if he had ſaid: Goe to nowe, when as God ſhall haue ſhewed me this fauour to inſtruct me, what is then my dutie to do? Forſooth, I muſt euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayſe him, for that I ought to be thereto the more ſtirred vp, and to be greatlier occaſioned therein. And ſince I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God too teach mee, what fruite ſhall I reape thereby, when as he ſhall haue called me vnto the waye of ſaluation? I ſhall then haue wherefore too ſing prayſes vnto his holy name, knowing the grace which hee hath beſtowed on me. See then how that in this proteſtation Dauid ſpeaketh not to bynde God, through any recompenſe or ſeruice: but onely ſtirreth his ſelfe vp, and pricketh him ſelfe foreward as it were with a ſpurre, to the ende he might be the better diſpoſed, too receiue the benefite which God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him: and that he might knowe, that this benefite ought not to be an occaſion to make him vnthankefull vnto him
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7694:191"/>from whom he receiued it. Howebeit we are here briefly to conſider of two pointes. The one is, that as God hath liberally beſtowed vppon vs his graces, ſo much the more ought we to be ready to prayſe, and magnifie him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. For furely this is all the recompenſe that wee are any way able to yelde him, if ſo bee,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.</note> it may bee called recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe: howebeit hee accepteth it thankefully vnder this title, as the ſcripture thereof maketh mention. Since then it is ſo, if wee will not that the benefite which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon vs, turne it ſelfe into condemnation by reaſon of our vnthankefulneſſe, let vs be well aduiſed to diſcharge our ſelues towardes him: and ſo, when as hee ſhall haue layde open his goodneſſe vpon vs, let vs not bee forgetfull of it, neither yet let our mouthes be cloſed vp, but euen to acknowledge the ſame vnto him.</p>
            <p>And thus much as touching the firſt point. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is, That he which ſhalbe wel and duely inſtructed in the word of God, let him ſhewe it, yea in glorifying his name all the daies of his life. They then which are ſo colde in praiſing of God, do right wel ſhew, that they neuer felt what the power of the worde is. And thy ſo? Bicauſe it is impoſsible for vs to haue any taſte of the worde of God, to receiue thereby any inſtruction, but that wee muſt needes bee moued and rauiſhed therewith to ſing prayſes vnto his glorious name. Whatſoeuer hee bee then that ſhall ſhewe him ſelfe negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent herein, ſufficiently inough declareth that hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what the worde of God is, albeit hee proteſt him ſelfe to be a Chriſtian. Let vs nowe come to thoſe, which are not onely dumbe them ſelues: but that, which is alſo worſe, which would ſhut vp the mouthes of others, to the ende it might not bee lawefull for them too prayſe God. And yet forſooth theſe men are ſo ſhameleſſe, as that they woulde notwithſtanding bee taken for good Chriſtians: but by theſe meanes they declare them ſelues too bee the deadly enemies of God, yea worſe then the very deuilles.
<pb facs="tcp:7694:192"/>And why ſo? Forſooth they thinke it not inough that they haue nothing profited in the ſchoole of God, neither yet are they contented to ſhewe the waye, to doe well, vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but they would haue al the world to be like vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, that there ſhould neuer mention bee made of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, &amp; yet in the meane while, as I haue already ſaide, this word Chriſtian ſhall ſtand them in neuer a peny. Nowe without all dout. God diſaloweth of all thoſe, which will not giue them ſelues to ſing praiſes vnto his maieſtie, and that will not ſtirre vp their neigh bours to doe the like, that they might ſhewe them ſelues to haue ſtudied his woorde. But let vs bee well aſſured, that it is notinough, too open our mouth and to ſing praiſes vnto him with the tongue: but it muſt alſo come from a well affected heart. For Dauid telleth vs nothere, that hee will ſolemnize the praiſes of God: but in addreſsing him ſelfe vnto God, hee proteſteth before him, that he will ſing prayſes vnto him. And in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this, he right wel knoweth that his heart muſt needes be diſpoſed thereto. Wherfore, when as we would magnifie the name of God as appertaineth, let vs not deliuer it out with the mouth onely: but our heart alſo muſt be ſet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and that it agree therewith to make a ſweete hermony. If this be ſo, all our life by litle and litle ſhalbe anſwerable thereto, that it ſhall bee no vntruthe which wee haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with our mouth. Now he addeth a ſentence which is very ſhort: to wit,</p>
            <q>My tongue ſhall treate of thy word: and why? bicauſe all thy commaundementes <hi>ſayeth he,</hi> are righteous.</q>
            <p>In this verſe he ſheweth that after he hath beene well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that he him ſelfe will alſo trauell to bring others by little and little, to the like knowledge.</p>
            <p>Loe here his full pretence. But yet the better to expreſſe his affection that hee hath too drawe on his brethren and neighbours, to the knowledge of God and of his truth, hee vſeth this word, to Sing, not contenting him ſelfe to ſpeake after a plain maner: but expreſsing, that he wil ſing alowde and cleare: that he will make his word to reſounde, that it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7694:192"/>might be heard, yea that it ſhould be a thing as notoriouſly knowne, as the very common ſonges. Nowe ſince it is ſo, that Dauid ſpeaketh after this ſort, let vs nowe ſee what our duetie is. For as I haue already ſaid heretofore, he bragged not of his owne power: but the holy Ghoſt hath ſet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs in ſteade of a glaſſe, to thend it might ſerue vs for our better inſtruction. Nowe when as we ſhall haue knowne the truthe of our good God, what is there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs to do? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, we muſt not holde faſt this treaſure as it were lockt vp in a cheſte, but communicate his graces vnto others: yea and doe the beſt wee can, to drawe on the miſerable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt people, too the ſeruice of God: and too carry about with vs the doctrine, to publiſh it to all men, when as it is committed vnto vs as a treaſure, and to beſtowe the gifte which we haue receiued, vpon our neighbours, according to that meaſure of faith, which God hath giuen vs. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this order is farre of from vs: For if there be but three wordes of the worde of God ſpoken, we wil ſoone be wery of it, may, we ſhall not heare it ſpoken of at this day. It is ſo farre of, that it is talked of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both at the table, in the waye, and euery where, as that we can hardly abide, that euen for faſhions ſake, the preaching of it be kept: and although it be here lawefull too ſpeake in the pulpit one houre in the name of God, yet ſhall you haue a great number of dogges which will not ſticke euen to gyrne at it, as if God were too too much priuiledged. It is very farre of to haue euery man to apply him ſelfe to ſing the commaundementes of God, and his whole worde, and for vs to haue our eares beaten with it. Nowe whence commeth this vnthankefulneſſe? verely bicauſe wee neuer taſted of that which Dauid here addeth, <hi>All thy ſtatutes</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>are righteous.</hi> If wee did throughly know, what equitie and pureneſſe there is in the ſtatutes of God, without dout we ſhould be more earneſt, to learne, holde, and ſhewe them, vnto others, then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue beene. So then, all they which make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt too inſtruct their neighbours, and do not eſteeme of the knowledge and faith which they haue receiued: doe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:193"/>hereby ſhew, that they will not render the righteouſneſſe to God as to him appertameth, accordingly as it is conteined in his word, and as he him ſelfe ſheweth it therein. Nowe Dauid by and by addeth,</p>
            <q>Let thine hand helpe me: for I haue choſen thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</q>
            <p>He yet returneth too that which before hee had ſayde of deliuerance. For after he had required to be taught of god, he ſaide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O deliuer me: yea hee right wel knewe that if hee had not him for his protector, that hee ſhoulde alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as it were in death. Now he addeth, <hi>Let thyne hand helpe mee.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>For I haue choſen,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When hee deſireth God too helpe him with his hande, he confeſſeth his want, and that hee was as a man which needed help, euen as though he had neuer had more need: and that it was not in him, to deliuer himſelf, neither could he find it in any of his creatures. And therfore except God had ſtretched foorth his hand, ſee howe Dauid had beene vtterly caſt away. Nowe, this confeſsion here is very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for vs. For which of vs is he, that can be without afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? and that is able to ſaye, I haue all things that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie? It is moſt true, that we are more carefull for that which concerneth our bodies, and this preſent life, then for that which is required for the ſaluation of our ſoules. If we ſtand in neede of meate and drinke, if wee be ſicke, if we be in daunger of any plague or warre, that ſtirreth vs, and toucheth vs too the quicke: but when wee are preſſed with any euill, we abuſe our ſelues, and lifte our ſelues vp in ſuch a fond preſumption, as that we thinke wee haue ſome power to do this, and that we then make our ſelues beleeue, that we are very well able to defende our ſelues, although not wholy, yet at the leaſt partly. And therefore wee ought ſo much the rather rightly to marke, the ſayings of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture where it is ſaide vnto vs, that it is the hande of GOD that muſt helpe vs, to the ende that euery man may learne to knowe his neede, and that we had all neede too bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7694:193"/>fended by this heauenly power: ſo that we are all caſt down into the bottomleſſe depth, without it pleaſeth GOD to ſtretch forth his hande to helpe our neceſsities. And thus much for this. Now when Dauid ſetteth downe the reaſon, that he had choſen the commaundements of God, he did it not to extoll any dignitie or worthineſſe of his owne. Wherefore then? Forſooth, euen to ſhewe that he wayted for his ayde and helpe, from the hand of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they which perſwade them ſelues at aduenture that God heareth their prayers, and yet haue this fooliſh hope with them, to finde helpe at the handes of his creatures: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the hande of God as much as in them lieth: and ſo by that meanes ſhall neuer finde him to bee fauourable vnto them. And for this cauſe Dauid ſaith, <hi>I haue choſen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God,</hi> that is to ſaye, that all his whole li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was in them. And this ſaying importeth a very great matter, and much greater then at the firſt ſight it ſeemeth. Why doth Dauid rather ſet downe this worde Election, or choiſe, then any other? I haue choſen thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. It is bicauſe wee are alwayes carried with peruerſe affections, and bicauſe we cannot make choiſe, neither can we hold vs to that which is beſt. Euery man wil gladlieſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that thing which is meeteſt for his own eaſe, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: to be ſhort, euery man deſireth to be happy. Wee are nothing indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t herein: for the very wicked in the world, and the moſt vile perſons, wil ſaye, I would haue that which were good and meete for me: howbeit wee can not choſe: but euen the very worſt. Wee ſhall very well haue a naturall deſire, which ſhall carry vs as it were to one ſelfe ſame end: but we cannot keepe the waye. Euery man goeth out of it. One ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will choſe this thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another that &amp; in this choyſe we are all confounded. One will choſe, goodes, landes, and poſſeſsions: another, great trade of marchandiſe: another to come vnto dignitie and into credit: ſome one man will be giuen to lecherie, and bee wholy carried that way: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will yelde him ſelfe, too ſome other filthineſſe, as too drunkenneſſe, intemperancy, and wantonneſſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:194"/>
            <p>See then, how we al make choiſe of that which is naught, And for this cauſe Dauid ſaieth, that he choſe the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of God: to wit, that although hee was a mortall man, ſubiect too a great number of wicked affections, yet that he neuer truſted his owne fleſh, neither yet obeied his luſtes, to choſe nothing but vanitie, and that which might withdrawe him from the right way, and leade him too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but that he made a good wiſe choiſe: to wit, that he helde himſelfe to the commandements of God. So then, let vs learne to make a good choiſe: when as God ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto vs his worde, when as he ſhall offer him ſelfe ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally on his part, as to looke for nothing at our handes but that we ſhould come to ſeeke him, and that hee preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him ſelfe before vs: let not vs be deceiued nor carried away by the deceiptes of Satan, through the corruptions which he layeth wyde open before our eyes: let vs not be ſo fooliſh as to ſtay our ſelues vpon matters of nothing, and to leaue that which ought to bee the moſt principall, and wherein lieth all our felicitie and ſaluation, It followeth,</p>
            <q>I haue longed for thy ſauing health, O Lorde, and in thy lawe is my delight.</q>
            <p>This ſentence comprehendeth all whatſoeuer wee haue already touched, and is the onely confirmation thereof. For he ſayeth, that he hath longed for the ſauing health of God. And howe is that? For it ſeemeth that euery man might ſay as much: and ſo, that Dauid had no more then the very faithleſſe. For if wee ſhall aſke a deſperate man, yea euen a very halfe deuill, and ſaye, wouldeſt not thou haue God to be thy ſauiour? he will make anſwere and ſaye, yes forſooth. Loe what anſwere wee ſhall finde in the mouthes both of great and ſmall, of good and bad.</p>
            <p>Nowe Dauid his meaning is, to make a great proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch a one as a very fewe can make in truthe. For we ſuppoſe him to be all our Sauiours: and yet we ſeeke our ſauing health at a wilde aduenture, and euery man will haue regarde to his owne conſiderations and prouidence.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7694:194"/>When there ſhall ariſe any queſtion of our maintenaunce here in this preſent life, do we beleeue that God muſt keep and preſerue vs, &amp; that it is hee in deede which mainteineth vs herein? whence commeth it that wee haue ſo mighty euill conſciences? whence commeth all deceiptes, fraudes, exceſſe, cruelties, iniuries, violences, and all ſuch like? What is the cauſe that maketh vs to liue with ſuch euil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences? but bicauſe wee do not beleeue, that God will giue vs our daily bread? Wee deſire God to feede vs, and yet wee will haue the deuill to do it: in ſo much that there are very fewe which at this day thinke, that that which they haue, commeth from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So then, it is very farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thought of our heartes, to ſaye, O Lorde, I haue deſired thy ſauing health. For in ſteade of attending vppon God, to haue him too guide, defende, and helpe vs at all times whenſoeuer that wee haue neede: in ſteade of this I ſaye, what doe wee? Euery man as I haue ſaide, ſeeketh for his ſauing health at a wilde aduenture. We ſhould rather ſeeke for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in hell, then to haue our eyes lifted vp into heauen to call vpon God, &amp; to ſeeke for our ſauing health both of body and ſoule in him. So then, there are very fewe which are able to ſaye as it is here ſet downe, O Lorde, I haue longed for thy ſauing health: if they will not lye. As we ſee the impudencie of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites which will make mighty great bragges inought but yet for all that, it is no ſmall matter, as I haue already ſayd, to truſt altogether in God, and to ſaye, that it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to him to guyde vs, that wee runne to him, and haue there our refuge both for ſoule and body. Nowe then hee addeth, <hi>In thy lawe is my delight:</hi> To ſignifie, how we ought to demeane our ſelues not to hope for ſaluation, nor yet to wiſhe for it otherwiſe then from God alone: to wit, when as we haue taken delight in his lawe.</p>
            <p>It is meete then that we tame and brydle our affections, that weſeuer them from all other our deſires, and ſaye, that in looking vpon his word and in cleauing thereto, we take there our repaſt, and in it doe truely ioye.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7694:195"/>
            <p>For whenſoeuer we ſhall be brought vnto this point, it will ſtande vs in nothing to ſeeke our ſauing health in God. And why ſo? bicauſe wee ſee none other thing in all the holy Scripture, but ſo many promiſes where God ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly biddeth vs, and where hee declareth vnto vs that hee is moſt ready to receiue vs, that hee looketh for none other thing at our handes but that we ſhould ſeeke him, and that he thruſteth him ſelfe forwarde, and preſenteth him ſelfe euen before vs. The Scripture, I ſay, is full of this doctrine, to ſhewe vnto vs that God is ready prepared too helpe vs when as we ſhall take pleaſure in his lawe. We may very wel then long after the ſauing health of God when as wee ſhall in truthe haue ſought him. But what? wee ſee very fewe whoſe heartes are ſo confirmed, as too ſaye that they will holde the right way, whatſoeuer commeth of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee heere conſequently why God diſapointeth vs, &amp; helpeth vs not, as wee gladly deſire to bee holpen. Nowe he addeth,</p>
            <q>Let my ſoule liue, and it ſhall praiſe thee: and let thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes helpe me.</q>
            <p>He alwayes purſueth his purpoſe, but here hee coupleth together two thinges which before he ſeuered. When hee ſayeth, let my ſoule liue that is alwayes, as he hath ſayd, that he ſeeketh his ſauing health of God, and longeth after it. He ſayeth not, I will that my ſoule liue: but hath recourſe vnto God knowing right well that hee is the keeper of his life: and therefore putteth it into his handes, and leaueth the keeping thereof v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to him, as appertaining onely vnto him and after he ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth that hee will giue him thankes, for that his life ſhall bee prolonged.</p>
            <p>Nowe heere wee ſee too what ende the faithfull ought to deſire too liue in this worlde: to wit, that they might prayſe GOD: as it hath beene alſo ſpoken in the other places. And chiefly without going farre, in the ſong of Ezechias.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.</note> For there, as in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth &amp; thirteenth Pſalme, and as it were in the ſong of Ionas, it is ſhewed, that if we muſt liue, wee muſt not liue, for too liue (as wee ſaye)
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7694:195"/>and to haue none other regarde: neither yet, too ſay, I will onely liue to eate and drinke and to dwel heere in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world. But we muſt goe yet farther: to wit, wee muſt liue, to the ende to prayſe God: ſo that if this bee wanting in vs, Let vs wiſh to be a hundreth feete vnder the ground, that we may be neuer more ſpoken off. Loe, I ſay, how our life ſhall be bleſſed, and agreeable vntoo the will of God: to wit, when as we bend our ſelues to none other ende, but to prayſe and magnifie his holy and bleſſed name.</p>
            <p>Now in the meane while Dauid addeth, <hi>O let thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments helpe me.</hi> This is it which he had in effect before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the ſauing health of God. For he ſetteth the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt all the helpes which men and the faithleſſe are any way able too inuente for the ſeeking of God. For they ſuppoſe that they ſhall bee very well holpen elſe where, when as they ſhall haue their prety ſhiftes too think that the creatures ſhall be ſufficient inough to helpe them. When then theſe worldlings think too bring it ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to be defended without the ayde of God, they muſt needes be deceiued in forgetting the iudgements of God: to wit, his prouidence, whereby he vſeth to rule the world: as we muſt be fully aſſured that he holdeth the vngodly in a bridle, when as they ſkirmiſh, &amp; forcibly ſet them ſelues to hurt the good and innocent: and that it is too repreſſe the malice of all thoſe which torment his, becauſe he hath taken them into his hand and protection. See then, how the faithfull ought to put them ſelues to the Iudgementes of God, to wit, to this prouidence, by which all is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and gouerned. It is very true that God may very well arme all his creatures to defende and maintaine vs: but yet muſt we not ceaſe for all that to feele his hand, and too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde it by faith when as it ſhall helpe vs. Wee muſt not ceaſe too ſee this prouidence which is hidden from the faithleſſe, becauſe their ſpirites are wreathed vpp in horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble darkeneſſe.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, let not vs ceaſe too attribute all the helpe
<pb facs="tcp:7694:196"/>which we ſhall feele from the hand of God, vnto his iudge mentes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although hee hath inferior meanes too helpe vs, Nowe in the ende Dauid concludeth,</p>
            <q>I haue gone aſtray like a Sheepe that is loſte: ſeeke thy ſeruant for I doe not forget thy Commandements.</q>
            <p>Heere wee might thinke it very ſtraunge why Dauid ſayth, that hee hath ſtrayed like a loſte ſheepe, ſeeing that he addeth, That he hath not forgotten the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God, and that wee haue already ſeene by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly proteſtations, that it was his whole delight to ſerue God: yea and that it was too him more deere then Golde and Siluer. And howe is it then that he now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth him ſelfe vnto a loſte ſheepe. For to make plaine this hard point, it is commonly ſaid, that Dauid confeſſeth him ſelfe to be a ſtrayed ſheepe, yea notwithſtanding the great deſire that he had to pleaſe GOD, too gouerne his whole life aright, and yet that he ceaſed not to erre. This ſaying is very well verified in him ſelfe. For although that this appertaineth not vnto the whole life of Dauid: yet he had a terrible fall, and was like a pore loſte beaſte in the ſin which he committed with Bethſabe, Vrias wife: For it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that he had then forſaken God, and that he was as it were a loſt man. He might then very wel ſay, that hee had highly and mightely erred like a loſte ſheepe. But this might be taken more properly. That Dauid reſpected not the time wherin God had called him, &amp; ſet him in a good way: but rather reſpected his owne naturall eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſaith, O Lord, what am I of my ſelfe, without thou guideſt me? Alas what had become of mee? In what caſe had I beene? Where ſhould I haue firſt begunne? Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid then might very well make heere proteſtation of ſuch his condition as is comman with vs. For this is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thing amongeſt vs all, that wee all go aſtraye like wilde and forlorne beaſtes, vntill ſuch time as GOD repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and amendeth vs. For in what caſe ſhall GOD
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7694:196"/>finde vs, when as he choſeth vs vnto him ſelfe? doe not wee ſwarue from the way of ſaluation? Wee are not onely in the mountaines and deſerts: but alſo drowned ouer head and eares euen to the bottomleſſe depthes.</p>
            <p>So then, Dauid and wee with him may very well ſay, that wee are loſt ſheepe, vntill ſuch time as God ſheweth him ſelfe to be our Shephearde, and giueth vs the grace too fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe him. And yet there is another reaſon which made Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid to cal him ſelf a loſt ſheepe: &amp; this is the very true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the moſte naturall: to wit, becauſe he was deadly purſued of his enemyes, and was ſo hardly and greeuouſly perſecuted by them, as that he was like vnto a poore chaſed ſheepe. Who ſeeing the Woulfe to purſue him fleyeth from him into the Mountaines, thinking there to hide him ſelfe. Loe heere a poore ſheepe which ſhall eſcape the throte of the Woulfe: he is ſo hartely afrayd, that if he finde a wel, he wil ſooner leape into it, then too goe on any farder: for hee knoweth not what to doe, not what ſhall become of him: beeing thus mortally purſued. And therfore Dauid ſaying, that hee erred like a loſt ſheepe referred it not vnto his ſins, to ſay, O Lorde, I haue offended, I haue ſtrayed from the way of ſaluation: but he ſayeth, O Lord, I know not what ſhall become of me. Heere then wee nowe ſee what the naturall meaning of this text is, wherevpon we muſt chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtay our ſelues. Although the doctrine which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready touched be very good and profitable, yet muſt wee haue teſpect vnto the meaning of Dauid. I haue then erred ſaith he, like a loſte ſheepe. Nowe he ſayth,</p>
            <q>O ſeeke the Seruaunt, for I doe not forget thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
            <p>When as we ſhall ioyne theſe twoo things togither, That Dauid forgot not the Commaundements of God, and that he hath erred: we ſhall finde, how greatly he was giuen to the ſeruing of God, that he deſired it from the bottome of his heart: and yet was he not without extreeme affliction: yea he was ſo voyde of helpe, as that it ſeemeth hee coulde
<pb facs="tcp:7694:197"/>not chooſe but deſpaire of his ſauing health. When then we ſee ſuch an example, haue not we very good occaſion to take courage, although God ſuffereth vs many times to bee euen extreemely perſecuted? For if this came to paſſe in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid who was ſo excellent a man, as we haue ſpoken off: Let not vs think to be greatlyer priuiledged then he. But let vs chiefely conſider to be patient in our afflictions, ſeeing that GOD thereby meaneth to make proofe of our faith and patience, and will cauſe it all too turne vnto our ſaluation. And this is it which Dauid concludeth withall, O Lorde, ſeeke thy ſeruant: ſignifying, that he ſtayeth him ſelfe chife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the protection and ſauegarde of God. And ſee howe wee muſt order our ſelues in this behalfe: For if wee can ſtay our ſelues vpon him, when as wee ſhall be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and beſeech him to ſeeke vs, wee muſt not doubt but that hee will make vs too feele his helpe, yea, and that wee ſhall obtayne our ſaluation when as wee ſhall there ſeeke it.</p>
            <p>According vntoo this holy Doctrine let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good GOD, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our offences, beſeeching him, that it woulde pleaſe him to make vs feele them better then heeretofore wee haue doone. And in the meane while that it woulde alſo pleaſe him to helpe all our miſeryes, and too giue vs this ſoueraigne remedy, to witte, to be purged of all our wicked affections, that the lawe might raigne wholy in vs, haue full poſſeſſion both of our thoughts and deſires, and of all whatſoeuer elſe there is in vs: and we too bee ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by it, as that forſaking all the things of this world, and of this preſent life, wee craue and deſire none other thing but to cleaue vnto our good GOD, and too bee wholy conformable vnto his holy will.
